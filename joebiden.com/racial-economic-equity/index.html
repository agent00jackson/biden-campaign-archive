    <h1 class="bfp__title--largest page__title">The Biden Plan to Build Back Better by Advancing Racial Equity Across the American Economy</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="page__content-wrap">
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe Biden’s jobs and economic recovery agenda is built on the proposition that we must build our economy back better than it was before the COVID-19 crisis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last month, Biden has been laying out his vision for a stronger, resilient, and inclusive economy. He believes in an economy where every American enjoys a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead. An economy more vibrant and more powerful precisely because everybody will be included in the deal. An economy where Black, Latino, Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI), and Native American workers and families are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">finally</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> welcomed as full participants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, multiple, overlapping crises reinforce how far we have to go to deliver on that vision. The pandemic has shone a bright light on racial disparities in health and health care &#8212; as Black and Brown Americans have suffered and died from the coronavirus at rates far higher than white Americans. The economic crisis has hit Black and Brown communities especially hard, with Black unemployment at 15.4 percent, Latino unemployment at 14.5 percent, and businesses owned by </span><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w27462"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black, Latino, and Asian American people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> closing down at alarming rates. We are also seeing a national reckoning on racial justice and the tragic human costs of systemic racism in the murder of George Floyd and so many other Black men, women, and children. And through it all, the climate crisis mounts, with air and water pollution, superstorms and extreme weather, disproportionately impacting Black and Brown communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden believes we cannot build back better without a major mobilization of effort and resources to address these challenges and to advance racial equity across the American economy. That is why racial equity is a distinct pillar of his Build Back Better plan, as well as incorporated in each of the other pillars. Biden will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">remove barriers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to participation in our economy, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">expand access</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to opportunity, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully enforce</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the policies and laws that we already have on the books &#8212; and the pledges Biden has made in this campaign. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In laying out his Build Back Better agenda, Biden has announced bold investments &#8212; in infrastructure, innovation, manufacturing, education, housing, clean energy, federal procurement, and small businesses.</span><b> Today, as the fourth pillar of the Build Back Better Agenda, he is announcing how he will direct many of these investments to advance racial equity as part of our nation’s economic recovery. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, Biden will:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spur Public-Private Investment through a New Small Business Opportunity Plan</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reform Opportunity Zones to Fulfill Their Promise</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make a Historic Commitment to Equalizing Federal Procurement</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure His Housing Plan Makes Bold Investments in Homeownership and Access to Affordable Housing for Black, Brown, and Native Families</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Achieve Equity in Management, Training, and Higher Education Opportunities Connected to the Jobs of the Future</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boost Retirement Security and Financial Wealth for Black, Brown, and Native Families</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure Workers of Color Are Compensated Fairly and Treated With Dignity</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure Equity in Biden’s Bold Infrastructure and Clean Energy Investments </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support Second Chances for Economic Success</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strengthen the Federal Reserve’s Focus on Racial Economic Gaps</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promote Diversity and Accountability in Leadership Across Key Positions in All Federal Agencies</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build a 21st Century Care Infrastructure </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Address Longstanding Inequities in Agriculture</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>SPUR PUBLIC-PRIVATE INVESTMENT THROUGH A NEW SMALL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY PLAN</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small business ownership is one of our country&#8217;s cornerstones for wealth building and job creation. However, persistent racial disparities in wealth and access to capital, combined with outright discrimination in the financial sector, have contributed to inequities in small business ownership, growth, and success. To address the racial wealth gap, the opportunity gap, and the jobs gap for Black and Brown people, Biden will launch a historic effort to empower small business creation and expansion in economically disadvantaged areas – and particularly for Black-, Latino-, AAPI-, and Native American-owned businesses. In addition to providing small businesses with an ambitious “</span><a href="../reopening.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restart package</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” to survive the current crisis and come out the other side strong, he is launching a special, ongoing initiative to empower these entrepreneurs to succeed and grow with a three-prong Small Business Opportunity Plan. His plan is consistent with key elements in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jobs and Neighborhood Investment Act </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently proposed by Democratic Senators Chuck Schumer, Mark Warner, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris. Biden will:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b><b>Spur more than $50 billion in additional public-private venture capital to Black and Brown entrepreneurs <span style="font-weight: 400;">by funding successful state and local investment initiatives and making permanent the highly effective New Markets Tax Credit.</span></b></b></li>
<li>Expand access to $100 billion in low-interest business loans <span style="font-weight: 400;">by funding state, local, tribal and non-profit lending programs in Black and Brown communities and strengthening Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs), and the Community Reinvestment Act. </span></li>
<li>Eliminate barriers to technical assistance and advisory services <span style="font-weight: 400;">by investing in a national network of cost-free business incubators and innovation hubs and intensive business seminars. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Collectively, Biden will leverage more than $150 billion in new capital and opportunities for small businesses that have been structurally excluded for generations.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Biden will devote $30 billion (or 10%) of the $300 billion in innovation funding as part of his plan to ensure the future is “Made in All of America” to the Small Business Opportunity Fund to leverage private investment of $5 for each $1 of new public investment to reach this $150 billion.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">And, by empowering the financial institutions that support businesses owned by Black and Brown people, generating new capital, and providing robust technical assistance, Biden will unleash the full potential of small businesses and entrepreneurs. </span></p>
<p><b>Spur More than $50 Billion in New Equity Investment and Venture Capital for Entrepreneurs in Economically Disadvantaged Areas: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black and Brown entrepreneurs face unique barriers to obtaining the capital that they need to start and grow a business. For example, three-fourths of venture capital goes to just four cities – and far too little flows to businesses owned by Black and Brown people. To address this problem, Biden will: </span><b> </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Dramatically increase the availability of venture capital investments for small businesses, especially those owned by Black and Brown people. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Obama-Biden Administration’s State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) succeeded in expanding venture capital in states and areas too often left behind. More than </span><a href="https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sb-programs/Documents/SSBCI%20Program%20Evaluation%202016%20-%20Full%20Report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">80% of venture capital supported by the SSBCI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> went to states that typically receive just 20% of private venture capital. Biden will expand those efforts by allocating $10 billion from the new Small Business Opportunity Fund to state and local venture capital programs that, based on past SSBCI investments, can spur $50 billion in new equity investment for small businesses. This new investment will be targeted to entrepreneurs who create jobs and growth in lower-income urban, tribal, and rural areas, with an emphasis on reaching businesses owned by Black and Brown people. This robust funding will help meet the goal Biden laid out in his “Made in All of America” initiative of venture capital and innovation investments benefiting all Americans across all of America.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Encourage private equity investment in businesses owned by Black and Brown people by expanding the New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) to $5 billion yearly and making it permanent</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  The NMTC provides a credit of up to 40% for equity investment in small businesses that are pre-approved as benefiting low- and moderate-income areas. It is </span><a href="https://www.cdfifund.gov/Documents/NMTC%20Fact%20Sheet_Jan2018.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">highly efficient</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Every $1 of public funding leverages $8 of private investment. Through 2019, the NMTC supported $100 billion of investments in businesses and economic development projects to help revitalize disadvantaged communities. Expanding the NMTC will provide more investors the incentive to fund businesses owned by Black and Brown people. By increasing NMTC funding and making it permanent  – together with the bold new venture funding in the Small Business Opportunity Fund – Biden will help ensure that more than $50 billion in additional venture and equity capital flows to small businesses and communities that have been held back due to systemic racism. And he will work to ensure that tribal projects benefit from the credit.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Leverage $100 Billion in Additional Financing for Small Businesses: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, only 10% of funding from the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) </span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/aboutsbaarticle/WebsiteReport_asof_20190830.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">major lending programs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> went to Black, Latino, and Native American entrepreneurs. Meanwhile, the Paycheck Protection Program has been rife with inequities: A recent “secret shopper” </span><a href="https://ncrc.org/lending-discrimination-within-the-paycheck-protection-program/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition found that when Black small businesses applicants contacted a bank, nearly half the time, they were given inferior treatment to white applicants with nearly identical credit histories and business profiles. To address this problem, Biden will:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Expand lending through the expanded Small Business Opportunity Fund. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every $1 for state lending programs under the Obama-Biden SSBCI was proven to leverage anywhere from $5 to $23 of increased lending for small businesses through lending programs like capital access programs, revolving loan funds, and collateral assistance. Approximately 80% went to small businesses with </span><a href="https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sb-programs/Documents/SSBCI%20Program%20Evaluation%202016%20-%20Full%20Report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10 or fewer full-time employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Biden will dramatically expand and broaden successful state, local, tribal, and non-profit programs that provide low-cost lending to minority small businesses and others serving underserved areas. In addition to supporting state initiatives for disadvantaged small businesses, Biden will also include an innovation fund that will allow coalitions of cities, CDFIs, or non-profits to seek funding to create or expand small business lending programs that disproportionately benefit small businesses owned by Black, Latino, AAPI, and Native American people and those serving low income communities.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Capitalize Community Development Financial Institutions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. CDFIs are on the frontlines of the battle </span><a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/reports/2018/02/21/447051/systematic-inequality/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to close the racial wealth gap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Biden will seek to expand the role of CDFIs in underserved communities around the country by doubling their direct funding, making them a top vehicle for funding from the Small Business Opportunity Fund, and expanding their capacity to offer both micro-loans to small start-ups and larger loans to existing small businesses who have the capacity to grow. Biden will use the Small Business Opportunity Fund to strengthen CDFI stability and lend through targeted policies, such as those proposed in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jobs and Neighborhood Investment Act</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He will also ensure these investments direct increased resources to the Native American CDFI Assistance Program (NACA Program), which has proven a successful way to increase capital access across Indian Country.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Ensure all small business relief efforts are specifically designed to aid businesses owned by Black and Brown people. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump’s team designed the PPP to allow the largest banks to give their most well-off clients “concierge” service at the front of the line while closing the door on Black-, Latino-, AAPI-, and Native American-owned businesses that did not have deep relationships with big banks. Biden will ensure from the start that any emergency small business relief plan that will still be needed in January 2021 will have clear provisions to ensure that true small businesses — especially those owned by Black and Brown people and those serving underserved rural, tribal, and urban areas — get the relief they need. He will reserve half of new small business relief — whether the PPP or future efforts — for small businesses with 50 employees or fewer, including microbusinesses and sole proprietorships, so the bigger and more well-connected aren’t able to win in a first-come, first-served race.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden’s technical assistance programs — described below — will also involve “navigator” assistance for small — often minority-owned — businesses to ensure fair access to these programs. </span></li>
<li><b>Strengthen and expand the Community Reinvestment Act to ensure that our nation’s bank and non-bank financial services institutions are serving all communities<span style="font-weight: 400;">. The </span><a href="https://www.occ.treas.gov/topics/consumers-and-communities/cra/index-cra.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community Reinvestment Act</span> </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">currently regulates banks, but does little to ensure that “fintechs” and non-bank lenders are providing responsible access to all members of the community. On top of that gap, the Trump Administration is </span><a href="https://ncrc.org/proposed-changes-to-the-community-reinvestment-act-will-be-disastrous-for-low-and-moderate-income-communities/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><a href="https://nationalfairhousing.org/2019/12/13/diverse-coalition-issues-joint-statement-on-proposed-changes-to-community-reinvestment-act/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">weaken</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the law by allowing lenders to receive a passing rating even if the lenders are excluding many neighborhoods and borrowers. Biden will expand the Community Reinvestment Act to apply to mortgage and insurance companies, add a requirement for financial services institutions to provide a statement outlining their commitment to the public interest, and, importantly, reverse new rules that allow these institutions to avoid lending and investing in all of the communities they serve.</span></b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Expanding Access to Additional Resources and Technical Assistance for Black and Brown Entrepreneurs: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are no limits or barriers to the talent and entrepreneurial spirit across our nation. Yet, for many, there are major limits to accessing the networks and professional services needed to succeed. For small businesses in underserved communities, this type of assistance is often unavailable or unaffordable, creating an additional barrier to opportunity. As President, Biden will launch an Expanding Entrepreneurship Initiative that provides all Americans, regardless of their background, with the resources and technical assistance they need to start and grow their own business. This initiative will: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Create a national network of federally funded small business incubators and innovation hubs.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Many new businesses stand to benefit from the proliferation of for- and non-profit business incubators and innovation hubs. However, these organizations do not exist in every community and are rarely free. As President, Biden will increase federal funding for non-profit incubators and innovation hubs around the country, especially those serving Black, Latino, AAPI, and Native American entrepreneurs to ensure that all Americans, regardless of race or wealth, have a fair shot at starting and growing their own business. Biden will co-locate new hubs on the grounds of Small Business Development Centers, public libraries, community colleges, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs). These non-profit organizations will offer shared office and manufacturing space; business coaching; opportunities to partner with national laboratories and commercialize federally funded research; and legal, human resources, accounting, regulatory compliance, and information technology services to aspiring entrepreneurs free of charge for a period of up to two years. While some incubators and innovation hubs may specialize in specific industries depending on the regional economy, they will welcome and support all start-ups.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Establish an intensive, semester-long business development program at every public community college in the United States, as well as two-year HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Americans with a business idea don&#8217;t know where to get started. While business classes exist, many of them are prohibitively expensive, especially for an aspiring entrepreneur who is already worried about how they are going to come up with enough money to open their first business. As President, Biden will create a new federal grant program to establish free business development programs at the </span><a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ovae/pi/cclo/ccfacts.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 1,000 public community colleges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around the country. Business experts and, where possible, experienced entrepreneurs will lead course instruction and provide hands-on assistance to program participants. Classes will take place during the evenings and on weekends to provide greater flexibility to students and instructors. Upon completion of the free program, participants will be eligible for ongoing technical assistance for up to two years.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Increase the funding and stature of the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA). </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Latino and Black Americans are roughly </span><a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=race&amp;hidePreview=false&amp;tid=ACSDP5Y2018.DP05&amp;vintage=2018"><span style="font-weight: 400;">30% of the U.S. population</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; yet they currently own </span><a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/abs/data.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">just 7.5% of small businesses with employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For almost four years, the only federal agency charged with addressing racial disparities in small business ownership has been on the Trump administration’s chopping block. MBDA provides business consulting services and connects minority-owned businesses with capital and contracting opportunities. These services are critical. Instead of trying to reduce or eliminate funding for MBDA, Biden will protect the agency and call on Congress to increase its funding dramatically. Biden will elevate the Director of the MBDA to the Assistant Secretary level and instruct the MBDA to coordinate all federal offices charged with reducing barriers to procurement for underrepresented groups. With additional resources and authority, MBDA will also be able to create new business development grants and other programs that will address the economic challenges facing Black and Brown communities, expand small business ownership, and shrink the racial wealth gap. In addition, Biden will provide MBDA with $5 billion in annual lending and investment authority to ensure capital flows directly to minority-owned businesses and investments in critical infrastructure in Black, Latino, AAPI, and Native American communities.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Unleash the full potential of businesses owned by Black and Brown people and other disadvantaged businesses to participate in the global marketplace. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden believes American small businesses can compete and win in global markets &#8211; and small businesses owned by Black and Brown people have unique strengths to help win in these markets.  Biden will help Black and Brown Americans grow their exports by: 1) requiring U.S. corporations with over $1 billion in revenues that receive federal financing or incentives for their global business to publicize data on their use of firms owned by Black and Brown Americans in their supply chains; 2) requiring the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation and other U.S.-based international development organizations to increase global contracting opportunities for firms owned by Black and Brown Americans; 3) requiring U.S. construction companies and others that build projects abroad for the United States government to develop strategies to increase partnerships with American small businesses owned by Black and Brown people; and 4) requiring the Export-Import Bank to increase its small business financing and develop targets for the percent of authorized value of its transactions going to businesses owned by Black and Brown Americans.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Employ the resources of the federal government to protect Native artisans. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arts and crafts are a big economic driver for Indian Country, but too many businesses devalue the livelihood of Native American artists by selling fake Native American art. Biden will call on the U.S. Department of Justice to bring more prosecutions under the Indian Arts and Crafts Act, a federal truth-in-advertising law that prohibits the marketing and sale of products that are inaccurately marketed as an Indian product or Native-produced.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>REFORM OPPORTUNITY ZONES TO ENSURE THEY SERVE BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES, SMALL BUSINESSES, AND HOMEOWNERS</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like many Americans, Biden initially hoped that Opportunity Zones would be structured and administered by the Trump Administration in a way that advanced racial equity, small business creation, and homeownership in low-income urban, rural, and tribal communities. It is now clear that the Trump Administration has failed to deliver on that promise in too many places around America. As the Urban Institute has found, the program as a whole is “not living up to its economic and community development goals.” While there have been positive examples, in too many instances investors favor high-return projects like luxury apartments over affordable housing and local entrepreneurs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We cannot close the racial wealth gap if we allow billionaires to exploit Opportunity Zones tax breaks to pad their wealth, rather than investing in projects that benefit distressed low-income communities and Americans that are struggling to make ends meet. As President, Joe Biden will task his team to develop a plan for reforming Opportunity Zones, including steps like: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incentivizing Opportunity Funds to partner with non-profit or community-oriented organizations, and jointly produce a community-benefit plan for each investment, with a focus on creating jobs for low-income residents and otherwise providing a direct financial impact to households within the Opportunity Zones. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Directing that Opportunity Zone benefits be reviewed by the Department of Treasury to ensure these tax benefits are only being allowed where there are clear economic, social, and environmental benefits to a community, and not just high returns — like those from luxury apartments or luxury hotels — to investors.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introducing transparency by requiring recipients of the Opportunity Zone tax break to provide detailed reporting and public disclosure on their Opportunity Zone investments and the impact on local residents, including poverty status, housing affordability, and job creation. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>MAKE A HISTORIC COMMITMENT TO EQUALIZING FEDERAL PROCUREMENT AS PART OF HIS BOLD PROCUREMENT PLAN</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden&#8217;s Build Back Better plan includes a historic procurement effort designed to support small businesses and tackle </span><a href="https://www.mbda.gov/sites/mbda.gov/files/migrated/files-attachments/ContractingBarriers_AReviewofExistingDisparityStudies.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">long standing inequities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the federal contracting system. During his first term, Biden will tighten Buy American requirements for existing procurement and invest $400 billion in additional federal purchases of products made by American workers. And, he will make transparent, targeted investments that unleash new demand for domestic goods and services and create American jobs in communities across the country. As part of this effort, his multi-pronged small business contracting strategy will include formula-based awards; widespread outreach and counseling to small business owners, especially Black and Brown business owners; and transparent, frequent monitoring of contract awards. This will make certain that the largest mobilization of public investments in procurement, infrastructure, and R&amp;D since WWII is equitably distributed across communities and businesses. Biden will also take concrete steps to streamline the federal procurement process as a whole and ensure it finally mirrors the demographics of this country. Specifically, Biden will:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Require prime contractors to develop and execute plans to increase subcontracting opportunities for small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs). </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">As President, Biden will fully enforce existing laws that require prime contractors who bid for federal procurement opportunities to develop ambitious plans for subcontracting with small disadvantaged businesses. Biden will ensure prime contractors honor their commitments to SDBs by requiring detailed status updates and increasing SBA’s capacity to provide robust oversight and hold all bad actors accountable. Prime contractors will also have to regularly publish their business diversity data. The MBDA will publish an annual report that outlines the current state of minority business contracting (including racially disaggregated data on contract awards), updates the public on the administration’s progress towards meeting contracting goals, and identifies areas for improvement.</span></li>
<li><b>Expand long-term technical assistance and federal contracting preferences for small disadvantaged businesses.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> The SBA</span><a href="https://www.sba.gov/federal-contracting/contracting-assistance-programs/8a-business-development-program"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 8(a) program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is currently one of the most effective tools for connecting small disadvantaged businesses to federal contracting opportunities. In Fiscal Year 2019 alone, </span><a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44844.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">8(a) firms won $30 billion in federal contracts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As President, Biden will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">triple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the federal goal for contracting with all small disadvantaged businesses </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">from 5 percent to a minimum of 15 percen</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t of all federal procurement dollars by 2025. He will increase the program’s administrative capacity, bolster marketing of the program in Black and Brown communities and tribal lands, streamline the application process, and create a national standard for service delivery. Biden will also extend the maximum length of time that a firm may participate in the 8(a) program and create a more supportive off-ramp to help graduates transition out. Biden will require public disclosure of program participant demographics to ensure participation is equitable.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Incentivize state and local governments and private sector partners to contract with small disadvantaged businesses.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> As Biden works to improve the federal procurement system, he will ask state and local governments and private sector partners to publicly share their small disadvantaged business contracting goals and strategies. Biden will work with them to develop new goals for SDB contracting and timebound strategies for achieving these goals. The administration will facilitate partnerships between these entities and require every institution that applies for federal grants, contracts, and other opportunities to demonstrate in writing how they are taking affirmative steps to extend contracting opportunities to underrepresented groups. And, he will publish a nationwide scorecard of each state&#8217;s efforts to contract with small disadvantaged businesses. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Protect small disadvantaged businesses from federal and state contract bundling which often prevents smaller firms owned by Black and Brown people from effectively bidding on procurement contracts. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden will build on the anti-bundling provisions of the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, by having the Office of Management and Budget, SBA, and MBDA conduct a government-wide review of existing contract bundling to determine whether agencies are following existing rules and whether agencies have the ability to further ensure small business participation in federal and state procurement opportunities.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Strengthen implementation of the Buy Indian Act </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">within the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Health Service to increase procurement opportunities for Native owned businesses.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout, Biden will ensure federal dollars support American workers and their families. As called for in his </span><a href="../labor/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to strengthen worker organizing, collective bargaining, and unions, Biden will require that all companies receiving procurement contracts are using taxpayer dollars to support good American jobs, including a commitment to pay at least $15 per hour, provide paid leave, maintain fair overtime and scheduling practices, and guarantee a choice to join a union and bargain collectively. </span></p>
<p><b>ENSURE HIS HOUSING PLAN MAKES BOLD INVESTMENTS IN HOMEOWNERSHIP AND ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR BLACK, LATINO, NATIVE, AND AAPI FAMILIES</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden believes the middle class isn’t a number, but a value set that includes the ability to own your own home and live in a safe community. Housing should be a right, not a privilege.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, however, far too many Americans lack access to affordable and quality housing. Racial inequality permeates U.S. housing markets, with </span><a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/reports/2019/08/07/472617/systemic-inequality-displacement-exclusion-segregation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">homeownership rates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Black, Latino, AAPI, and Native American households far below those of their white counterparts. Because home ownership is how many families save and build wealth, these racial disparities in home ownership contribute to the racial wealth gap. It is far past time to put an end to systemic housing discrimination and other contributors to this disparity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, many families around the country face immediate risk of eviction in the midst of the Trump-created economic crisis. In June, more than one-third of renters—including 49% of Hispanic families and 43% of Black families— were not sure that they could pay their next month’s rent. To prevent a catastrophic rise in evictions and homelessness, Congress and President Trump must act now by creating a broad emergency housing support program modeled on the steps the government takes to address natural disasters, in order to get help out quickly and at scale.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help families build wealth, secure a safe place to live in a vibrant and prosperous community, and ensure equal access to all aspects of the housing market, Biden will:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Help families buy their first homes and build wealth by creating a new refundable, advanceable tax credit of up to $15,000. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden’s new First Down Payment Tax Credit will help low- and middle-income families offset the costs of home buying and help millions of families lay down roots for the first time. Building off of a </span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/first-time-homebuyer-credit-questions-and-answers-basic-information"><span style="font-weight: 400;">temporary tax credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expanded as part of the Recovery Act, this tax credit will be permanent and advanceable, meaning that homebuyers receive the tax credit when they make the purchase instead of waiting to receive the assistance when they file taxes the following year.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Scale up support for investing in homeownership in revitalization areas. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several programs are designed to provide much needed support for families to invest in homeownership in distressed or marginalized neighborhoods including: HUD’s Good Neighbor Next Door program, which offers financial support for teachers, firefighters, and other critical workers to buy homes in distressed communities, and HUD’s Home Investment Partnership Program, which offers block grants for states to address the affordable housing challenges faced by low- and moderate-income families. And the proposed </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3316"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neighborhood Homes Investment Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will provide tax credits for families to renovate distressed properties in distressed communities. A Biden Administration will scale these programs to help revitalize distressed neighborhoods across the nation and put more families into position to build wealth through homeownership.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Spur the construction of 1.5 million homes and public housing units to address the affordable housing crisis, increase energy efficiency, and reduce the racial wealth gap. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden will make a bold federal investment in new affordable, accessible housing construction. He will ensure these homes are energy efficient from the start – saving the families who live there up to $500 per year. Biden will also drive additional capital into low-income communities and on tribal lands to spur the development of affordable housing and small business creation. He’ll incentivize smart regional planning that connects housing, transit, and jobs, improving quality of life by cutting commute times, reducing the distance between living and leisure areas, and mitigating climate change. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For all of these new housing investments, those receiving assistance will be required to abide by high labor standards and source materials in the U.S. so that jobs created with these investments support family sustaining wages and benefits.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Call for more accurate, non-discriminatory, inclusive credit scoring and create a p</b><a href="https://www.demos.org/policy-briefs/establish-public-credit-registry"><b>ublic credit reporting agency</b></a><b>.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Being able to obtain an accurate credit report and score  is a critical step for homeownership. But today credit scoring and reports, which are issued by just three large private companies, are rife with problems: they often contain errors, they leave many </span><a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201505_cfpb_data-point-credit-invisibles.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“credit invisible”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> due to the sources used to generate a credit score, and they contribute to </span><a href="https://www.nclc.org/images/pdf/credit_discrimination/Past_Imperfect050616.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">racial disparities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Biden will create a new public credit reporting and scoring division within the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to provide consumers with a government option that seeks to minimize racial disparities, for example by ensuring the algorithms used for credit scoring don’t have a discriminatory impact, and by accepting non-traditional sources of data like rental history and utility bills to establish credit. As a first step to more broad-based support for these scores, Biden will call on federal housing programs to accept these scores in their financial assessments and underwriting requirements</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Protect homeowners and renters from abusive lenders and landlords through a new Homeowner and Renter Bill of Rights. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modeled on the </span><a href="https://oag.ca.gov/hbor"><span style="font-weight: 400;">California Homeowner Bill of Rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Biden will enact legislation to end many shortcomings in the mortgage and rental markets. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Bolster programs that improve housing affordability for renters</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Biden will provide Section 8 housing vouchers to every eligible family so that no one has to pay more than 30% of their income for rental housing and work with Congress to enact a new renter’s tax credit, designed to reduce rent and utilities to 30% of income for low-income individuals and families who may make too much money to qualify for a Section 8 voucher but still struggle to pay their rent. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Protect tenants from eviction. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to supporting immediate relief for tenants facing eviction during this crisis, Biden will work to enact Majority Whip James E. Clyburn and Senator Michael Bennet’s </span><a href="https://www.majoritywhip.gov/?press=majority-whip-clyburn-sen-bennet-reps-price-clarke-and-khanna-introduce-legislation-to-provide-legal-assistance-to-tenants-facing-eviction"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legal Assistance to Prevent Evictions Act of 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which will help tenants facing eviction access legal assistance. He also will encourage localities to create eviction diversion programs, including mediation, payment plans, and financial literacy education programs.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Eliminate local and state housing regulations that perpetuate discrimination. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exclusionary zoning has for decades been strategically used to keep Black and Brown people and low-income families out of certain communities. Among other steps, Biden will enact legislation requiring any state receiving federal dollars through the Community Development Block Grants or Surface Transportation Block Grants to develop a strategy for inclusionary zoning, as proposed in the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/4808"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HOME Act of 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Majority Whip Jim Clyburn and Senator Cory Booker. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Hold financial institutions accountable for discriminatory practices in the housing market.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Obama-Biden Administration held major national financial institutions accountable for discriminatory lending practices, securing </span><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/disparate-impact-and-fair-housing-seven-cases-you-should-know"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hundreds of millions of dollars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in settlements to help borrowers who had been harmed by their practices. And in 2013, the Obama-Biden Administration </span><a href="https://www.hud.gov/sites/documents/DISCRIMINATORYEFFECTRULE.PDF"><span style="font-weight: 400;">codified</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a long-standing, court-supported view that lending practices that have a discriminatory impact can be challenged even if discrimination was not explicit. But now the Trump Administration is </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/08/19/2019-17542/huds-implementation-of-the-fair-housing-acts-disparate-impact-standard"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seeking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to gut this disparate impact standard by significantly increasing the burden of proof for those claiming discrimination. In the Biden Administration, this change will be reversed to ensure financial institutions are held accountable for serving all customers and not practicing policies that have the effect of deepening the impacts of systemic housing discrimination.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Roll back Trump Administration policies gutting fair lending and fair housing protections for homeowners. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden will implement the Obama-Biden Administration’s </span><a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/AFFH_Final_Rule.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Rule</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requiring communities receiving certain federal funding to proactively examine housing patterns and identify and address policies that have a discriminatory effect. The Trump Administration </span><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2018-00106.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suspended</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this rule in 2018. Biden will ensure effective and rigorous enforcement of the Fair Housing Act and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. And, he will reinstate the federal </span><a href="https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/housing/mfh/progdesc/riskshare542c"><span style="font-weight: 400;">risk-sharing program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which has helped secure financing for </span><a href="https://www.ncsha.org/advocacy-issues/fha-hfa-risk-share-program/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">thousands</span> </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of affordable rental housing units in partnership with housing finance agencies.   </span></li>

<p><b>ACHIEVE EQUITY IN MANAGEMENT, TRAINING, AND HIGHER EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES CONNECTED TO JOBS OF THE FUTURE</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stark racial disparities exist at every stage of our education system. These disparities compound and contribute to inequity in economic, health, housing, and criminal justice outcomes. As President, Biden will make significant investments into educational institutions and programs that are designed to elevate Black and Brown students.  He will: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Provide relief from student debt. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student debt burdens are unequal across races, disproportionately depriving young Black and Latino graduates from beginning their working lives free of crushing student loan debt. The typical bachelor’s degree graduate has about </span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/black-white-disparity-in-student-loan-debt-more-than-triples-after-graduation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$16,000 in debt compared to $23,400</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Black students. According to a recent </span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-looming-student-loan-default-crisis-is-worse-than-we-thought/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brookings Institution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> study, Black graduates with a four year degree are five times more likely to default on their student loans than white graduates and a 2019 study found that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Latino students are more likely than white students to default on their loans. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inequitable burden of student loan debt contributes to the stark racial wealth gap that exists in society. Biden has introduced a sweeping plan to provide relief from student loan debt. He will:</span></li>
<li><b>Include in the COVID-19 response an immediate cancellation of a minimum of $10,000 of federal student loan debt.</b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Double the maximum value of Pell grants and significantly increase the number of middle-class Americans who can participate in the program. </b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>More than halve payments on undergraduate federal student loans by simplifying and increasing the generosity of today’s income-based repayment program. </b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Fix the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program and forgiving $10,000 of undergraduate or graduate student debt for every year of national or community service, up to five years.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Crack down on private lenders profiteering off students </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">by empowering the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to take action against private lenders who are misleading students about their options and do not provide an affordable payment plan when individuals are experiencing </span><a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_annual-report_student-loan-ombudsman_2017.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">acute periods of financial hardship</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Forgive all undergraduate tuition-related federal student debt from two- and four-year public colleges and universities and private HBCUs and MSIs for debt-holders earning up to $125,000. </b></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Make public colleges and universities, as well as private HBCUs and MSIs,  tuition-free for all families with incomes below $125,000.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Biden will make public colleges and universities and private HBCUs and MSIs tuition-free for all students whose family incomes are below $125,000. This proposal will help roughly </span><a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?tid=ACSDT5Y2018.B19001B"><span style="font-weight: 400;">91 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Black households and </span><a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?tid=ACSDT5Y2018.B19001I"><span style="font-weight: 400;">88 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Latino households, and </span><a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?tid=ACSDT5Y2018.B19001C"><span style="font-weight: 400;">91 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Native American households. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Support colleges and universities that play unique and vital roles in their communities. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his higher education plan, Biden laid out a wide-ranging plan to improve resources available to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges And Universities (TCUs), Hispanic-serving Institutions (HSIs), Asian American And Native American Pacific Islander-serving Institutions (AANAPISIs), Alaska Native-serving Institutions and Native Hawaiian-serving Institutions (ANNHs), Predominantly Black Institutions (PBIs), and Native American-serving Nontribal Institutions (NASNTIs) that serve a disproportionate number of Black and Brown students, yet are severely under-resourced, especially when compared to other colleges and universities. Biden will:</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Make HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs more affordable for their students. Biden will provide tuition-free access to four-year public HBCUs and MSIs for students from families earning below $125,000. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, he will invest in grants to under-resourced, private-nonprofit HBCUs and MSIs so they can lower the cost of attendance for low- and middle-income students, including DREAMers. Schools receiving funds must invest in lowering costs, improving retention and graduation rates, and closing equity gaps year-over-year for Black and Brown students.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Invest in the diverse talent at HBCUs, TCUs and MSIs to solve the country’s most pressing problems.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Biden Administration will invest $10 billion to create at least 200 new centers of excellence that serve as research incubators and connect students underrepresented in fields critical to our nation’s future – including fields tackling climate change, globalization, inequality, health disparities, and cancer – to learning and career opportunities. These funds will provide additional work study opportunities and incentivize state, private, and philanthropic dollars for these centers. Biden will also boost funding for agricultural research at land-grant universities, many of which are HBCUs and TCUs, as outlined in his </span><a href="../rural.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plan for Rural America</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As President, Biden will also dedicate additional and increased priority funding streams at federal agencies for grants and contracts for HBCUs and MSIs. And, he will require any federal research grants to universities with an endowment of over $1 billion to form a meaningful partnership and enter into a 10% minimum subcontract with an HBCU, TCU, or MSI.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Build the high tech labs and facilities and digital infrastructure needed for learning, research, and innovation at HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden will invest $20 billion in infrastructure for HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs to build the physical research facilities and labs urgently needed to deliver on the country’s research and development, to update and modernize deteriorating facilities, including by </span><a href="https://clyburn.house.gov/press-release/clyburn-reintroduces-hbcu-historic-preservation-reauthorization-bill"><span style="font-weight: 400;">strengthening the Historic Preservation program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and to create new space for increasing enrollments, especially at HSIs. While schools will be able to use these funds to upgrade the digital infrastructure, Biden will also support TCUs and other institutions in rural areas by investing $20 billion in rural broadband infrastructure and tripling funding to expand broadband access in rural areas. Additionally, as President, Biden will ensure all HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs have access to low-cost </span><a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/692809.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal capital financing programs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and will work with states to ensure they can take advantage of these programs. And, he will work to incentivize further public, private, and philanthropic investments in school infrastructure.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Provide support to continuously improve the value of HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs by investing $10 billion in programs that increase enrollment, retention, completion, and employment rates. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">These programs may include partnerships with both high schools, other universities, and employers; evidence-based remedial courses; academic and career advising services; and investing in wages, benefits, and professional development and benefits to recruit and retain faculty, including teacher residencies. Additionally, Biden will incentivize states, private, and philanthropic dollars to invest in these programs, while ensuring schools that do not receive matches increase their competitiveness.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Expand career pathways for graduates of HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs in areas that meet national priorities, including building a diverse pipeline of public school teachers.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Biden will invest $5 billion in graduate programs in teaching, health care, and STEM and will develop robust internship and career pipelines at major research agencies, including Department of Energy National Laboratories, National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, and the Department of Defense. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Triple and make permanent the capacity-building and student support for HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs in Title III and Title V of the Higher Education Act. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">These funds serve as a lifeline to under-resourced HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs year over year, ensuring that the most vulnerable students have the support they need to succeed. The Biden Administration will increase Title III and Title V funding to provide a dedicated revenue stream of $7.5 billion over the first ten years.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Reduce disparities in funding for HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden will require federal agencies and states to publish reports of their allocation of federal funding to colleges and universities. When inequities exist between HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs and similar non-HBCU, TCU, MSI colleges, federal agencies and states will be required to publish robust rationale and show improvements in eliminating disparities year-over-year. To ensure funding is more equitably distributed among HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs, the Biden Administration will require that competitive grant programs make similar universities compete against each other, for example, ensuring that HBCUs only compete against HBCUs. And, President Biden will require higher education accreditors to provide increased transparency in their processes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Provide two years of community college or other high-quality training program without debt for any person looking to learn and improve their skills, especially to connect these individuals with the millions of job opportunities created by the historic investments in Biden’s Build Back Better Plan. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">As President, Biden will enact legislation to ensure that every person can go to community college for up to two years without having to pay tuition. Individuals will also be able to use these funds to pursue training programs that have a track record of participants completing their programs and securing good jobs. This initiative will be available for recent high school graduates and adults who never had the chance to pursue additional education beyond high school or who need to learn new skills. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Tackle the barriers that prevent students from completing their community college degree or training credential.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> There are too many Americans who don’t complete their education or training programs not because of a lack of will, but because of other responsibilities they are juggling, such as a job to pay their bills or caring for children. The Biden Administration’s community college initiative will be a first-dollar program, meaning that students will be able to use their Pell grants, state aid, and other aid to help them cover expenses beyond tuition and fees. In addition, Biden will give states financial incentives to foster collaboration between community colleges and community-based organizations to provide wraparound support services for students. Wraparound support services can range from public benefits and additional financial aid to cover textbook and transportation costs that often keep students from staying enrolled, to child care and mental health services, faculty mentoring, tutoring, and peer support groups. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Make a $50 billion investment in workforce training, including community-college business partnerships and apprenticeships. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">These funds will create and support partnerships between community colleges, businesses, unions, state, local, and tribal governments, universities, and high schools to identify in-demand knowledge and skills in a community and develop or modernize training programs – which could be as short as a few months or as long as two years – that lead to a relevant, high-demand industry-recognized credential. These funds will also exponentially increase the number of apprenticeships in this country through strengthening the Registered Apprenticeship Program and partnering with unions who oversee some of the best apprenticeship programs throughout our nation, not watering down the quality of the apprenticeship system like President Trump </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/03/11/2020-03605/apprenticeship-programs-labor-standards-for-registration-amendment-of-regulations"><span style="font-weight: 400;">is doing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden will also make investments in pre-apprenticeship programs so that people of color have additional pathways into high-paying, union jobs in everything from designing to building infrastructure to manufacturing to technology to health. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And he will closely monitor programs that receive funding and track participants’ completion rates and employment outcomes to ensure that all Americans, regardless of background, share the benefits of this historic investment. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Help develop pathways for diverse workers to access training and career opportunities.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A </span><a href="https://wdr.doleta.gov/research/FullText_Documents/ETAOP_2018-04_1-WIA-30mo-main-rpt.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Labor Department-funded individual career services — which included assistance looking for a job, help developing career plans, and one-on-one career coaching — found that earnings for workers who were provided these services increased 7 to 20%. Biden will ensure these services are universally available to all workers and people entering the workforce who need them. And, he will increase funding for community-based and proven organizations that help women and people of color access high-quality training and job opportunities.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Require publicly traded companies to disclose data on the racial and gender composition of their corporate boards</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Corporate boards suffer from a widespread dearth of diversity, with just 21 percent of S&amp;P 500 board seats going to people of color and only 27 percent going to women. As President, Biden will require that public companies disclose in their annual reports the racial and gender composition of the boards to better aid shareholders and advocates in their call for a diverse and inclusive management structure.  </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>BOOST RETIREMENT SECURITY AND FINANCIAL WEALTH</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black and Brown families &#8211; and especially Black and Brown women &#8212; face disadvantages at every turn, from access to workplace retirement accounts to access to generational wealth. These disadvantages have resulted in large and persistent gaps in financial wealth. To help Black and Brown people have more opportunities to build up a nest egg, Biden will</span><b>:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Equalize the tax benefits of defined contribution plans: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current tax benefits for retirement savings are based on the concept of deferral, whereby savers get to exclude their retirement contributions from tax, see their savings grow tax free, and then pay taxes when they withdraw money from their account. This system provides upper-income families with a much stronger tax break for saving and a limited benefit for middle-class and other workers with lower earnings. Biden will equalize benefits across the income scale, so that low- and middle-income workers will also get a tax break when they put money away for retirement.  </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Give small businesses a tax break for starting a retirement plan and giving workers the chance to save at work</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As proposed by the Obama-Biden Administration, the Biden plan will call for widespread adoption of workplace savings plans and offer tax credits to small businesses to offset much of the costs. Under Biden’s plan, almost all workers without a pension or 401(k)-type plan will have access to an “automatic 401(k),” which provides the opportunity to easily save for retirement at work – putting millions of middle-class families on the path to a secure retirement.</span></li>

As President, Biden will ensure that federal government-led investment pools, including pension funds and endowments, allocate their assets in a manner that reflects the diversity of the country, including to asset management firms owned by Black and Brown people. And Biden will require sales of any government assets to include participation of firms owned by Black and Brown people.  </span></li>

The Trump Administration reversed this progress, implementing a new rule that leaves millions of workers behind — including <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/trump-overtime-proposal-april-update/">3 million workers of color</a>. Since Trump walked away from protecting these workers who are fighting for a place in the middle class, they have lost over <a href="https://www.epi.org/multimedia/overtime-pay-cut/">$3.2 billion</a> in foregone overtime wages.

As we build back better, Biden will make it easier for workers to organize unions and collectively bargain. He will include in the economic recovery legislation he sends to Congress a series of policies to build worker power to raise wages and secure stronger benefits. This legislation will make it easier for workers to organize a union and bargain collectively with their employers by including the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, card check, union and bargaining rights for public service workers, and a broad definition of “employee” and tough enforcement to end the misclassification of workers as independent contractors. It will also go further than the PRO Act by holding company executives personally liable when they interfere with organizing efforts.

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden’s Build Back Better plan includes a </span><b>national effort to create the jobs we need to build a modern, sustainable, accessible, infrastructure now and deliver an equitable clean energy future</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He will make a </span><b>$2 trillion accelerated investment</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with a plan to deploy those resources over his first term, toward that end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A major focus of this investment will be to upgrade the infrastructure and job opportunities in Black and Brown communities. Specifically, Biden will:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Set a goal that disadvantaged communities receive 40% of overall benefits of spending in the areas of clean energy and energy efficiency deployment; clean, accessible transit and transportation; affordable and sustainable housing; training and workforce development; remediation and reduction of legacy pollution; and development of critical clean water infrastructure. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, Biden will directly fund historic investments across federal agencies aimed at eliminating legacy pollution — especially in Black and Brown communities, rural and urban low-income communities, and tribal communities — and addressing common challenges faced by disadvantaged communities, such as funds for replacing and remediating lead service lines and lead paint in households, child care centers, and schools in order to ensure all communities have access to safe drinking water and wastewater infrastructure. These investments will create good-paying jobs in frontline and fenceline communities. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Ensure the jobs building roads and bridges and schools and overhauling water systems and electricity grids are filled by diverse, local, well-trained workers – including Black and Brown people – </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">by requiring federally funded projects to meet </span><a href="../infrastructure.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high labor standards,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> including paying prevailing wage, prioritizing Project Labor and Community Workforce Agreements, and employing workers trained in registered apprenticeship programs. Biden will make investments in pre-apprenticeship programs and in community-based and proven organizations that help Black and Brown people access high-quality training and job opportunities. Biden’s proposal will make sure national infrastructure and clean energy investments create millions of middle-class jobs that develop a diverse and local workforce with a choice to join a union, strengthening communities as we rebuild our physical infrastructure.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Revolutionize municipal transit networks.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Biden will aim to provide all Americans in municipalities of more than 100,000 people with quality, accessible public transportation by 2030. He will allocate flexible federal investments with strong labor protections to help cities and towns install light rail networks and improve existing transit and bus lines.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Ensure clean, safe drinking water and water infrastructure is a right in all communities – rural to urban to tribal lands, rich and poor. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">From lead contamination in places like Flint, Michigan to the lack of potable water which contributes to the spread COVID-19 on the Navajo Reservation, too many communities face public health crises because of lack of basic water infrastructure.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden will invest in the repair of water pipelines and sewer systems, replacement of lead service pipes, upgrade of treatment plants, and integration of efficiency and water quality monitoring technologies. This includes protecting our watersheds and clean water infrastructure from man-made and natural disasters by conserving and restoring wetlands and developing green infrastructure and natural solutions. And, he will work to ensure adequate, resilient water infrastructure in Black and Brown communities everywhere, especially Indian Country. African American and Latino households are </span><a href="http://uswateralliance.org/sites/uswateralliance.org/files/Closing%20the%20Water%20Access%20Gap%20in%20the%20United%20States_DIGITAL.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly twice as likely</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as white households to lack sufficient plumbing, and Native American households are </span><a href="http://uswateralliance.org/sites/uswateralliance.org/files/Closing%20the%20Water%20Access%20Gap%20in%20the%20United%20States_DIGITAL.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">19 times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more likely. In Indian Country, this also means ensuring tribes have water rights needed to develop the infrastructure necessary to serve homes, businesses, and agricultural needs. The Obama-Biden Administration settled </span><a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/whncaa_report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">twelve important water rights settlements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, more than any other Administration in history. These settlements supported </span><a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/whncaa_report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$3 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of investment in Indian Country, for building important infrastructure for clean drinking water and agricultural needs, protecting tribal fisheries and culturally important areas, and furthering economic development initiatives. Biden will restore strong federal support for Indian water rights settlements and coordinate the actions of all relevant federal agencies to use their programs, authorities, and resources to support Tribal water needs and economic development activities. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Expand broadband, or wireless broadband via 5G, to every American </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– recognizing that millions of households without access to broadband are locked out of an economy that is increasingly reliant on virtual collaboration. Communities without access cannot leverage the next generation of “smart” infrastructure. As the COVID-19 crisis has made clear, Americans everywhere need universal, reliable, affordable, and high-speed internet to do their jobs, participate equally in remote school learning and stay connected. This digital divide needs to be closed everywhere, from lower-income urban schools to rural America, to many older Americans as well as those living on tribal lands. Just like rural electrification several generations ago, universal broadband is long overdue and critical to broadly shared economic success.</span></li>

In line with the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/865"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rebuild America’s Schools Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, backed by the House Education Committee, Biden will invest $100 billion in improving public school buildings and ensure its top funding priority is modernizing schools in the most economically underserved communities in our nation &#8212; all too often in Black and Brown communities. He will also ensure parents no longer search in vain for a suitable child care option by creating a new child care construction tax credit to encourage businesses to build child care facilities at places of work and making direct investments in building new child care facilities and upgrading existing facilities around the country.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Clean up and redeveloping abandoned and underused Brownfield properties, old power plants and industrial facilities, landfills, abandoned mines, and other idle community assets </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">that will be transformed into new economic hubs for communities all across America. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Revitalize communities in every corner of the country so that no one is left behind or cut off from economic opportunities. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden’s plan will ensure that our infrastructure investments work to address disparities – often along lines of race and class – in access to clean air, clean water, reliable and sustainable, accessible transportation, connectivity to high-speed internet, and access to jobs and educational opportunities. This includes ensuring tribes receive the resources and support they need to invest in roads, clean water, wastewater, broadband, and other essential infrastructure needs. It also means funding investments in local and regional strategies to prevent a lack of accessible transportation options in urban, rural, and high-poverty areas from cutting off after-school opportunities for young people and job opportunities for workers seeking better jobs and more economic security for their families.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Take land into trust for Indian tribes. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the most important roles the federal government plays in rebuilding the nation-to-nation relationship is taking land into trust on behalf of tribes. It is critical for tribal sovereignty and self-determination, allows for economic development, and helps support the well-being of tribal citizens, while also preserving tribal histories and culture for future generations. It helps to right the wrongs of past policy, including the dispossession by the U.S. government of </span><a href="https://www.usccr.gov/pubs/2018/12-20-Broken-Promises.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">90 million acres of tribal land</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, nearly </span><a href="http://www.ncai.org/policy-issues/land-natural-resources/trust-land"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two-thirds of all tribal land</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Obama-Biden Administration recognized this vital responsibility and took more than</span><a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/whncaa_report.pdf"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">half a million acres of land into trust for tribes</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212; including land that the Trump Administration tried to take away from the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe. As President, Biden will uphold trust and treaty responsibilities and continue to take land into trust for Indian tribes, helping tribes spur economic development. </span></li>

<p><b>SECOND CHANCES FOR ECONOMIC SUCCESS</b></p>

For people who are convicted of a crime, after they serve their sentence, they should have the opportunity to fully reintegrate into society, earn a good living, and participate in our democracy. It will not only benefit them, it will benefit all of society. It is also our best strategy to reduce recidivism. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The collateral consequences for a criminal record are vast. The National Institute of Justice found that there are more than </span><a href="https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/national-inventory-collateral-consequences-conviction"><span style="font-weight: 400;">44,000 collateral consequences</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> nationwide, </span><a href="https://niccc.csgjusticecenter.org/database/results/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">including</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">employment restrictions, loss of voting rights, denial of housing or even renting an apartment and educational loan restrictions to name a few. </span></p>
<p><b>Smart Data Infrastructure to Support Second Chances</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most states already have a process for people who want to shield their criminal record from public view &#8212; expungement and sealing. But getting a person&#8217;s record expunged or sealed is complicated and requires paperwork, time, and sometimes the support of legal counsel.</span></p>
<p><b>As President, Biden will advance a pathway for redemption and re-entry &#8211; and make real the possibility of second chances for all Americans &#8211; </b><b>by helping states modernize their criminal justice data infrastructure and adopt automated record sealing</b><b> for selected categories of non-violent offenses, to modernize their criminal justice data infrastructure. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This data infrastructure will facilitate sealing of records in a manner that is precise, complete and efficient &#8211; so those records are not used to deny people jobs, housing, voting rights, school loans and other opportunities to rebuild their lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The grants Biden is proposing will support state efforts to research, plan for, and ultimately implement the criminal record data infrastructure improvements that will make automated record relief possible. Beyond that, the infrastructure improvements will yield a general improvement in the operation and efficiency of state records. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, to invest in second chances and smart criminal justice reforms that will improve public safety, Biden will:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Set a national goal of ensuring 100% of formerly incarcerated individuals have housing upon reentry – at the federal and state level.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> He’ll start by directing the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to only contract with entities that are open to housing individuals looking for a second chance. And, he’ll expand funding for transitional housing, which has been </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-justice-prisons-exclusive/exclusive-trump-administration-reduces-support-for-prisoner-halfway-houses-idUSKBN1CI2ZA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drastically cut</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> under the Trump Administration.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Expand access to mental health and substance use disorder treatment, as well as educational opportunities and job training for individuals during and after incarceration. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden Administration will expand the use of drug courts and other diversion programs. The Biden Administration will also expand funding for all of these programs and services, during and after incarceration.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Eliminate existing barriers preventing formerly incarcerated individuals from fully participating in society.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> For example, Biden will eliminate barriers keeping formerly incarcerated individuals from accessing public assistance such as SNAP, Pell grants, and housing support. He will streamline the process for giving individuals on probation or parole for non-violent offenses access to the </span><a href="https://www.jobcorps.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Job Corps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Biden Administration will incentivize states to automatically restore voting rights for individuals convicted of felonies once they have served their sentences. And, the Biden Administration will expand on the Obama-Biden Administration’s </span><a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/11/30/fact-sheet-white-house-announces-new-commitments-fair-chance-business"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ban the box” policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by encouraging further adoption of these policies </span><a href="https://www.nelp.org/publication/ban-the-box-fair-chance-hiring-state-and-local-guide/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">at the state and local level</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This effort will not include any automatic restoration of firearms rights.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Eliminate cash bail. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cash bail is the modern-day debtors’ prison. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cash bail system incarcerates people based on their inability to pay&#8211;sometimes small amounts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And, it disproportionately harms Black and Brown people. Biden will lead a national effort to end cash bail and reform our pretrial system by putting in place a system that is fair and does not inject further discrimination or bias into the process.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">As President, Biden will establish a technical assistance program to help state and local jurisdictions transition to a fair, equitable and effective pretrial system that does not rely on cash bail. This project will be modeled after the Obama-Biden smart suite of programs, which used technical assistance and funding to drive targeted improvements in corrections, probation, and policing. The project will similarly allow state and local Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) recipients to access Bureau of Justice Assitance’s (BJA) bank of subject-matter experts if they agree to dedicate a portion of their existing JAG funds to work on BJA-approved initiatives that transition pre-trial systems away from a reliance on cash-bail and to evidence-informed systems that use risk of flight and/or danger to determine whether defendants should be held in  pre-trial detention.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>STRENGTHEN THE FEDERAL RESERVE’S FOCUS ON RACIAL ECONOMIC GAPS </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Reserve (the Fed) plays a highly influential role in determining the overall unemployment rate, as well as that of Black and Brown people. Within its existing mandate of promoting maximum employment and stable prices, the Fed should aggressively enhance its surveillance and targeting of persistent racial gaps in jobs, wages, and wealth. Biden will work with Congress to amend the Federal Reserve Act to require the Fed to regularly report on current data and trends in racial economic gaps &#8212; and what actions the Fed is taking through its monetary and regulatory policies to close these gaps. Access to affordable financial services is another first-order barrier to wealth building for many American families. Biden supports the Fed committing to a “real-time” payment system, a change the central bank has the authority to implement. With this system in place, instead of waiting days for checks to clear, low-income people will have instant access to money they are owed, ending an existing, costly burden to cash-constrained families.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fed should also revise its hiring and employment practices to achieve greater diversity at all levels of the institution &#8212; including at the leadership of the Board of Governors and the regional Federal Reserve Banks. </span></p>
<p><b>PRIORITIZE RACIAL EQUITY ACROSS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Apply the principles of Congressman Jim Clyburn’s 10-20-30 plan to ensure that federal dollars go to high-poverty areas that have long suffered disinvestment</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. To tackle persistent poverty in all communities, in both urban and rural America, Biden supports applying Congressman Clyburn’s </span><a href="https://clyburn.house.gov/press-release/clyburn-booker-announce-major-legislation-fight-poverty-america-new-report-details"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10-20-30 formula</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to all federal programs, targeting funds to census tracts with persistent poverty.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Promote diverse leadership for all federal agencies. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The leaders of federal agencies make decisions that have a direct impact on the nature of our entire economic system. At present the leadership of those agencies do not reflect the diversity of our country. As President, Biden will promote diverse leadership in the financial regulatory agencies including the FTC, CFTC, SEC, OCC, and FDIC; work with all branches of government including the Senate and Supreme Court, to create best practices and standards for ensuring racial diversity among clerks, staffers and interns; and create a new post within the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers to focus on racial equity including the income and wealth gaps. And, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">recognizing the special importance of appointing Native Americans to play critical roles in upholding the government-to-government relationship, he will build on the Obama-Biden Administration to ensure tribal nations have a strong voice and role in the federal government. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Eliminate language barriers for Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Language barriers to vital services and resources can prevent AAPI&#8217;s with limited English proficiency from realizing their potential and the American Dream. Biden will build on the work of the Obama-Biden Administration, which ensured that members of the AAPI community who were limited English proficient had access to health care and other government services. For example, the administration produced outreach videos in Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Burmese, Hmong, Khmer, and Lao to ensure that members of those communities were able to take advantage of the Affordable Care Act’s benefits and coverage. Biden will direct his agencies to identify ways to increase access to federal programs for AAPI individuals and families, including those who have limited English proficiency. He will also create neighborhood resource centers or welcome centers to help all residents find jobs; access services and English-language learning opportunities; and navigate the school system, health care system, and other important facets of daily life. And, he will ensure that all public schools have sufficient English-language learning support to help all children reach their potential.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Disaggregate data about the Asian American and Pacific Islander community to achieve equal representation. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Asian American and Pacific Islander community is one which includes people of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, the Philippines, and the Pacific Islands. Typically, when data is aggregated about this community it combines this wide swath of people into a single category &#8211; perpetuating the “model minority” myth by unwittingly masking specific challenges that segments of the AAPI population face. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data disaggregation is a strategy to collect information about the subgroups that make up a larger group, to surface issues when trying to understand the challenges that these communities face and identify solutions that are focused on closing disparity gaps. The Obama-Biden Administration released best practices for the disaggregation of federal data on AAPIs. Biden will build on this work and ensure that his administration recognizes and serves the myriad of challenges facing diverse AAPI communities.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Empower the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to fulfill its mission and address workplace discrimination</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A 2017 </span><a href="https://www.rwjf.org/en/library/research/2017/10/discrimination-in-america--experiences-and-views.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that 1 in 3 Latinos, 1 in 4 Asian Americans, 1 in 3 Native Americans, and more than half of African Americans had experienced racial discrimination in the workplace. Under a Biden Administration, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) will be fully empowered to address discrimination in the workplace and help close the harmful and unjust gaps in wages and employment opportunities. To strengthen the EEOC, Biden will double funding for the agency, empower the EEOC to initiate investigations for all areas of discrimination under its purview, and continue the Obama Administration effort&#8211;halted by President Trump&#8211;to expand the agency’s information collection efforts to include data on earnings gaps by race and gender.  </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>INVEST IN A 21ST CENTURY CARE INFRASTRUCTURE </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden believes that if we truly want to reward work in this country, we have to ease the financial burden of care that families are carrying, and we have to elevate the compensation, benefits, training and education opportunities for certification, and dignity of caregiving workers and educators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He will make substantial investments in the infrastructure of care in our country — to make child care more affordable and accessible for working families, and to make it easier for aging relatives and loved ones with disabilities to have quality, affordable home- or community-based care. And, he is proposing to give caregiving workers and early childhood educators a raise and stronger benefits, treating them as the professionals they are. Caregivers and early childhood educators — disproportionately Black and Brown women — have been underpaid, unseen, and undervalued for far too long. Biden will:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expand access to a broad array of long-term services and supports in local settings, including through closing the gaps in Medicaid for home- and community-based services and establishing a state innovation fund for creative, cost effective direct care services.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure access to high-quality, affordable child care and offer universal preschool to three-and four-year olds through greater investment, expanded tax credits, and sliding-scale subsidies.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build safe, energy-efficient, developmentally appropriate child care facilities, including in workplaces, so that parents and guardians never again have to search in vain for a suitable child care option.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Treat caregivers and early childhood educators with respect and dignity, and give them the pay and benefits they deserve, training and career ladders to higher-paying jobs, the choice to join a union and bargain collectively, and other fundamental work-related rights and protections.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>ADDRESS LONGSTANDING INEQUITIES IN AGRICULTURE </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black, Brown, and Native farmers have long faced barriers to growing their agricultural businesses, including unfair prices, unequal access to government support, retaliation for civil rights complaints, and outright injustice.  For more than 100 years the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) did little to alleviate the burdens of systemic inequality for Black, Brown, and Native farmers and was often the site of injustice. Over two decades ago, class action litigation was filed alleging longstanding discrimination against Black, Latino, Native, and women farmers. The cases dragged on for many years without relief for the complaints and impacted farmers struggled to regain the footing they lost before and during the litigation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A profound shift occurred for Black, Brown and Native farmers under the Obama-Biden administration during which the USDA oversaw the conclusion of what became the largest civil rights settlement in US history, bringing a painful chapter to a close. The settlements in these cases marked the beginning of a renewed commitment to supporting diversity, equity, and an internal reckoning for the USDA. Under Obama-Biden, the USDA sought to address both the structural and cultural causes of systemic inequality that had in prior generations been reproduced by the policies and practices of the agency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the groundbreaking steps to address inequality that were taken under Obama-Biden, the practices and values of the USDA slid backwards under the authority of the Trump administration &#8212; which ceased many agency-wide efforts to level the playing field. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As President, Biden will build upon the historic progress made during the Obama-Biden administration, taking additional steps to support the rights of Black, Brown and Native farmers by:  </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Establish an Equity Commission</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This equity commission will focus on the unique jurisdictional and regulatory barriers that Black, Brown, and Native farmers, ranchers, and fishers must negotiate and make sure that processes are streamlined and simplified to promote new and beginning farming and ranching operations by Black and Brown farmers. As President, Biden will direct his Department of Agriculture to review the Department’s programs – including in conservation, value-added agriculture support, finding new markets, data analysis, fisheries support, climate smart production, risk management, research and delivery of knowledge &#8212; and design a plan to ensure they are geared to farmers, ranchers, and fishers who are as different and varied as the landscape of the country. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Farm Land Purchase Assistance Program.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> As President, Biden will advance a comprehensive effort to assist in both the purchase of farmland and the ability of Black, Brown, and Native farmers to keep that land. This includes credit and technical support in the form of expedited credit, low-interest loans, and technical assistance. In addition, Biden recognizes the disadvantage that Black, Brown, and Native farmers face when they are forced to compete with other farmers who have decades of privileged access to federal assistance. As President, he will explore the use of land trusts, cooperative farm operations, and farm credit systems geared towards Black, Brown and, Native farmers as a means to support this population and diversify our agricultural sector.         </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Protect Heirs Property</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For over a century, Black, Brown, and Native farmers faced exploitation in policy and practice in a matter that limited their ability to retain a rightful claim to inherited property and to access federal programs. Building on recent Congressional bills and model legislation at the state level, Biden will implement guidelines and regulations that preserve heirs’ ownership of family farms and ensure that these landowners have equal access to federal credit and agricultural programs.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Establish a Farmland Trust. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This trust will support new farmers from underrepresented low-income communities to find, purchase, and succeed on farmland.  The Trust will also help connect these farms to marginalized communities locally and in urban or rural areas in an effort to develop and maintain a more diverse supply chain that provides entry points for aspiring entrepreneurs in the food production industry.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Advance Community Supported Agriculture (CSA)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As President, Biden will support and advance local production for farmers’ markets. He will work to maximize the use of unused land and to connect potential farmers with those landowners. Together farmers and landowners will pool acres into manageable units.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Advance fairness, accountability, and transparency at the United States Department of Agriculture</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> As President, Biden will appoint officials at every level of the USDA who have a demonstrated commitment to supporting Black, Brown and Native farmers. Biden will also eliminate the USDA’s backlog of civil rights complaints, streamline and expedite the complaints process, permit appeals, and reinstate a foreclosure moratorium for those whose complaints remain unsettled. Biden will direct the USDA to fully enforce whistleblower protections and investigate reports of retaliation and interference from the Office of General Counsel. In addition, Biden will demand transparency and oversight in all aspects of USDA’s operations. Further, Biden will call on the agency’s Economic Research Service to include farmworkers and farmers of color more prominently in their research. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Expanding protections for farm workers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Farm workers &#8211; who are disproportionately Latino and immigrant workers &#8211; have always been essential to working our farms and feeding our country. As President, Biden will ensure farm workers are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve, regardless of immigration status. He will work with Congress to provide legal status based on prior agricultural work history, ensure they can earn paid sick time, and require that labor and safety rules, including overtime, humane living conditions, and protection from pesticide and heat exposure, are strictly enforced.</span></li>
