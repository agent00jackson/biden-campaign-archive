  <div class="page__content-wrap">
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe Biden is going to build our country back better after this economic crisis and that includes ensuring we get closer to full inclusion of and equality for women. Women — particularly women of color — have </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">never</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had a fair shot to get ahead in this country. Today, too many women are struggling to make ends meet and support their families, and are worried about the economic future for their children. This was true before the COVID-19 crisis, but the current global health crisis has exacerbated these realities for women.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Biden, it’s a simple proposition: his daughter is entitled to the same rights and opportunities as his sons. He believes every issue is a women’s issue — health care, the economy, education, national security — but women are also uniquely and disproportionately impacted by many policies. As President, Biden will pursue an aggressive and comprehensive plan to further women’s economic and physical security and ensure that women can fully exercise their civil rights. Biden will:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Improve economic security. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden will start by fighting for equal pay, investing in women-owned small businesses, expanding access to education and training, and strengthening pay and benefits in careers disproportionately filled by women.</span></li>
<li><b>Expand access to health care and tackle health inequities. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden will expand access to high-quality, affordable health care for all women.</span></b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Help women navigate work and families.</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden will expand access to affordable child care and care for older Americans and people with disabilities, and provide paid leave and other important workplace benefits and protections.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>End violence against women.</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden will work to end violence against women, continuing his leadership on this issue since he authored the Violence Against Women Act in 1994.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Protect and empower women around the world.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Biden will start on day one of his Administration leading by example, making sure his political appointees, including his Cabinet, and our entire federal workforce look like the country they serve. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden has committed to selecting a woman to be his Vice President and an African American woman to be his first nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court, but his commitment to ensuring women help lead his Administration does not end there. As President, Biden will nominate and appoint people who look like the country they serve. He will reissue and mandate strict compliance with the Obama-Biden </span><a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2011/08/18/executive-order-13583-establishing-coordinated-government-wide-initiativ"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to promote diversity and inclusion in the federal workforce, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2018/05/01/new-opm-chief-presses-for-civil-service-overhaul-but-administration-is-less-interested-in-diversity/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">which President Trump has ignored</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He will modify it to mandate that Cabinet agencies and other executive branch agencies work with federal employee unions to create and implement a diversity and inclusion plan for the federal workforce. And, he will provide more training and mentoring opportunities to improve retention, and collect better data about who is applying for federal service positions as well as being promoted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Biden will also structure his Administration to ensure women&#8217;s issues remain at the forefront of policy efforts. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden knows that addressing the challenges faced by women and girls is more than just a campaign promise — it&#8217;s an imperative if the Administration is going to succeed in its broader efforts to make sure the government and economy work for all Americans. Biden will ensure that his administration aggressively protects the rights and addresses the unique needs of all women, including </span><a href="blackamerica.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black women</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Latina women, Native women, </span><a href="joe-bidens-agenda-for-the-asian-american-pacific-islander-community/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asian American and Pacific Islander women</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="disabilities.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">women with disabilities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="lgbtq-policy.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and queer women</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Obama-Biden Administration created the </span><a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/administration/eop/cwg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">White House Council on Women and Girls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to make sure the federal government was doing its best to tackle issues like equal pay, paid family leave, and poverty in an effective manner. The Trump Administration then </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/30/donald-trump-white-house-council-for-women-and-girls-239979"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disbanded it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and put nothing in its place. Biden will create a White House Council on Gender Equality, chaired by a senior member of the Executive Office of the President tasked solely with guiding and coordinating government policy that impacts women and girls, such as economic policy, health care, racial justice, gender-based violence, and foreign policy. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>As President, Biden will work with advocates across the country to pass the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) so women’s rights are once and for all explicitly enshrined in our Constitution. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden co-sponsored the ERA nine times. As President, he will work with advocates across the country to enshrine gender equality in our Constitution. Now that </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/01/15/796754345/virginia-ratifies-the-equal-rights-amendment-decades-after-deadline"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has become the 38th state to ratify the ERA, Biden will proudly advocate for Congress to recognize that 3/4th of states have ratified the amendment and take action so our Constitution makes clear that any government-related discrimination against women is unconstitutional. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>IMPROVE ECONOMIC SECURITY</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women hold only </span><a href="https://womenswealthgap.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">32% of the wealth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> men have accumulated and women of color only hold pennies on every dollar a white man holds. Women in the workforce, on average, earn less than men do. When they start a business, they have </span><a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2018/why-women-owned-startups-are-better-bet"><span style="font-weight: 400;">less access to capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and have to </span><a href="https://www.nwbc.gov/2018/03/01/the-latest-report-from-the-national-womens-business-council-on-women-business-owners-access-to-capital/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dip into their personal finances</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="https://www.nfcc.org/media-resources-center/gender-and-generational-differences-drive-increased-late-bill-payment-and-debt-collection-activity/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only 56% of women</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ages 18-34 are able to save, compared to 70% of men. And women — </span><a href="https://www.aauw.org/app/uploads/2020/05/Deeper_In_Debt_FINAL.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">primarily Black women</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — hold </span><a href="https://www.aauw.org/app/uploads/2020/05/Deeper_In_Debt_FINAL.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two-thirds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the nation’s student debt, both exacerbating and resulting from </span><a href="https://tcf.org/content/report/bridging-progressive-policy-debates-student-debt-racial-wealth-gap-reinforce/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">racial</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and gender wealth gaps. This is especially detrimental for the over</span><a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2019/05/10/469739/breadwinning-mothers-continue-u-s-norm/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">4 in 10 mothers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — especially women of color — who are sole or primary breadwinners for their families. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden will tackle this wealth gap, including by fighting for equal pay, ending other forms of workplace discrimination and harassment, encouraging and supporting women entrepreneurs and small business owners, making education and training more affordable, providing pathways into high-paying professions, expanding access to paid leave and child care, and strengthening union organizing and collective bargaining. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Fighting for Equal Pay</i></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

It can exacerbate other biases, with a magnified impact for women of color, transgender women, women with disabilities, and </span><a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/news/2013/04/09/59471/unequal-pay-day-for-immigrant-women/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">immigrant women</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lilly Ledbetter Act Fair Pay Act was the</span><a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/01/29/fact-sheet-new-steps-advance-equal-pay-seventh-anniversary-lilly"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">first piece of legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Obama-Biden Administration enacted, and Biden will continue to prioritize closing wage gaps and ending paycheck discrimination. </span><b>He strongly supports Senator Patty Murray and Congresswoman DeLauro’s </b><a href="https://edlabor.house.gov/imo/media/doc/2019-02-26%20Paycheck%20Fairness%20Section%20by%20Section.pdf"><b>Paycheck Fairness Act</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which codifies and expands critical Obama-Biden protections for workers’ paychecks. He will build on it as President and protect</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">workers against retaliation for discussing wages. Today, </span><a href="https://iwpr.org/publications/private-sector-pay-secrecy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one in four private-sector workers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are in a workplace where they can’t talk about their current wage rate with other employees without fear of retribution from their employers. </span><a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/wb/equal-pay-protections#collapse-equalpay"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the District of Columbia outlaw employers from retaliating against workers who talk about pay. Under a Biden presidency, it will be national. Biden will also:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Strengthen enforcement and accountability. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden will</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">take action to strengthen the ability of employees to challenge discriminatory pay practices and hold employers accountable. He will make it easier for employees to join together in class action lawsuits, shift the burden to employers to prove that any gender-based pay gaps exist for job-related reasons and business necessity, and increase penalties against companies that discriminate. And, he will hold companies accountable by expanding funding for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the U.S. Labor Department’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, and the U.S. Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division to increase the number of anti-discrimination investigators, litigators, and enforcement actions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Make wage gaps transparent.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Obama-Biden Administration </span><a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/01/29/fact-sheet-new-steps-advance-equal-pay-seventh-anniversary-lilly"><span style="font-weight: 400;">required medium and large employers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to collect and disclose compensation information by race, gender, and ethnicity to the federal government so it had better insight into pay disparities and could better target enforcement. </span><a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2020/03/02/480920/pay-data-matter-fight-equal-pay/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Trump Administration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> only continued to collect this data at the order</span><a href="https://src.bna.com/Mrp"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">of a federal court</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and has announced its intent to </span><a href="https://src.bna.com/Mrp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stop collecting pay data</span> </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for future years. Biden believes improving pay transparency is one essential step to ending the gender pay gap.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Level the negotiating playing field.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> By enacting the Paycheck Fairness Act, Biden will ban the use of salary history to set wages and make hiring decisions, so employers have one less false justification for under-paying women and people of color.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Make it easier for women and all workers to organize unions and bargain collectively. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unions help </span><a href="https://www.epi.org/blog/unions-help-narrow-the-gender-wage-gap/#:~:text=Unions%20have%20been%20proven%20to,share%20of%20nonunion%20men's%20dollar."><span style="font-weight: 400;">close the pay gap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between women and men. Women in unions earn 23% more than non-unionized women. Because Biden knows we need to build back better, he will include in the economic recovery legislation he sends to Congress a series of policies to build worker power to raise wages and secure stronger benefits. This legislation will make it easier for workers to organize a union and bargain collectively with their employers by including the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, card check, union and bargaining rights for public service workers, and a broad definition of “employee” and tough enforcement to end the misclassification of workers as independent contractors. It will also go further than the PRO Act by holding company executives personally liable when they interfere with organizing efforts. And, he’ll restore the ability of federal workers to unionize and collectively bargain. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read Biden’s full plan to encourage unionization and collective bargaining at </span></i><a href="labor/index.html"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">joebiden.com/empowerworkers</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Ending Other Forms of Workplace Discrimination and Harassment</i></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>End discrimination against pregnant and nursing workers.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When businesses refuse to give workers small, reasonable accommodations, like short breaks or easy access to water, pregnant workers are forced to choose between work and the health of their pregnancies. This is all too common in American workplaces, especially in industries where jobs are inflexible and physically demanding — and more likely to be held by women paid low wages, women of color, or immigrant women. Biden will follow the lead of </span><a href="https://www.nationalpartnership.org/our-work/resources/economic-justice/pregnancy-discrimination/reasonable-accommodations-for-pregnant-workers-state-laws.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than two dozen states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and support the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2694/text"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pregnant Workers Fairness Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, ensuring that employers offer women employees with reasonable workplace accommodations when their abilities are limited by pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Address harassment in the workplace. </b><a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/select-task-force-study-harassment-workplace#_Toc453686300"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tens of millions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of workers, most of whom are </span><a href="https://nwlc-ciw49tixgw5lbab.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/SexualHarassmentReport.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">women of color</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, report being sexually harassed at work. This harassment often </span><a href="https://iwpr.org/publications/sexual-harassment-work-cost/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leads to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> devastating consequences, including mental health problems and fewer opportunities for career advancement. In some egregious cases, women are forced out of their jobs. While harassment is illegal, there are too many barriers for people to seek justice. For example, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">60</span><a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/the-growing-use-of-mandatory-arbitration-access-to-the-courts-is-now-barred-for-more-than-60-million-american-workers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> workers have been forced to sign contracts waiving their rights to sue their employer and over </span><a href="https://nwlc-ciw49tixgw5lbab.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NDA-Factsheet-4.27.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one-third of the workforce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is bound by nondisclosure agreements that stop workers from speaking out about harassment and discrimination. As President, Biden will make systemic changes to address sexual harassment and other discrimination so workplaces are safe and fair for all. He will advocate for and sign into law the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2148/text"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bringing an End to Harassment by Enhancing Accountability and Rejecting Discrimination in the Workplace (BE HEARD) Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Better protect domestic workers, including care workers, from harassment and discrimination. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden will work to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">pass the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/2112/text"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Domestic Workers Bill of Rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so these workers — many of whom are women or people of color — are treated with dignity and respect.</span></li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Investing in Women-Owned Small Businesses</i></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190923005500/en/Woman-Owned-Businesses-Growing-2X-Faster-Average-Businesses"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> start businesses at two times the rate of men and now represent 42% of the nation’s businesses. But, they still raise much less capital — with only about </span><a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2018/why-women-owned-startups-are-better-bet"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2% of all venture capital funds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> going to women-owned businesses — </span><a href="https://www.nwbc.gov/2018/03/01/the-latest-report-from-the-national-womens-business-council-on-women-business-owners-access-to-capital/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">and are more likely to rely on personal funds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Biden will ensure women-owned small businesses have the capital, technical assistance, mentorship, and support they need to ensure they are able to grow. For example, Biden will:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Direct federal funding to women-owned businesses, including through his new historic $400 billion investment in additional federal purchases of products made by American workers, in his first term.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This will be the largest mobilization of public investments in procurement, infrastructure, and R&amp;D since WWII, and it will critically be designed to support small businesses and those owned by women and people of color. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Double funding for the State Small Business Credit Initiative.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Obama-Biden Administration created the </span><a href="https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sb-programs/Pages/ssbci.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Small Business Credit Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (SSBCI) to support small businesses, driving $10 billion in new lending for each $1 billion in SSBCI funds. Biden will extend the program through 2025 and double its federal funding to $3 billion, driving close to $30 billion of private sector investments to small businesses all told, especially those owned by women and people of color.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Improve and expand the Small Business Administration programs that most effectively support women-owned businesses, especially those owned by women of color. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately after taking office in 2009, the Obama-Biden Administration started to make </span><a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/documents/Women%20and%20Girls_Entrepreneurship%20and%20Innovation.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">billions of dollars in capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> available to women-owned businesses as part of the Recovery Act, and the Obama-Biden Administration’s Small Business Administration (SBA) made </span><a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/documents/Women%20and%20Girls_Entrepreneurship%20and%20Innovation.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expansive investments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the growth of women-owned small businesses. Recognizing that women, and particularly women of color, face disproportionate and systemic barriers to securing capital for their small businesses, the Obama-Biden Administration also redesigned SBA loan programs to </span><a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/documents/Women%20and%20Girls_Entrepreneurship%20and%20Innovation.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">better serve women business owners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Biden will build on this work and expand SBA programs that target women.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Expand Access to Education and Training</i></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden will ensure that women receive educational opportunities to unleash their full potential to grow a stronger, more inclusive middle class. He will aggressively enforce Title IX protections to ensure that women and girls receive full access to these opportunities, from admissions to financial aid to sports. In addition, he will:  </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Provide two years of community college or other high-quality training available without debt, invest in community college students’ success, and tackle the barriers that prevent students from obtaining their degree or credential. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women make up </span><a href="https://www.aacc.nche.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AACC_Fast_Facts_2020_Final.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly 60%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the students who attend community college. Working with limited resources, community colleges have figured out how to provide a high-quality, cost-effective education to students often juggling additional responsibilities, such as jobs or child care, many of whom are single mothers. But as a country, we haven’t invested enough in making sure community colleges reach women who could benefit from their programs, or improve their quality and completion rates. Biden will provide two years of community college or other high-quality training programs without debt for any hard-working individual looking to learn and improve their skills to keep up with the changing nature of work. And, he will create a new grant program to assist community colleges in improving their students’ success, while also taking steps to tackle the barriers — like juggling a job and taking care of children — that prevent women from completing their community college degree or training credential.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">He will give states financial incentives to foster collaboration between community colleges and community-based organizations to provide wraparound support services ranging from public benefits and additional financial aid to cover textbook and transportation costs, to child care and mental health services, faculty mentoring, tutoring, and peer support groups. And, Biden will establish a federal grant program to help community colleges create emergency grant programs for women who experience an unexpected financial challenge that threatens their ability to stay enrolled.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Make public colleges and universities tuition-free for all families with incomes below $125,000.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Biden will make public colleges and universities and private Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs) tuition-free for all students whose family incomes are below $125,000.

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Support colleges and universities that play unique and vital roles in their Communities.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Biden will invest over $70 billion in HBCUs, Tribal Colleges And Universities (TCUs), Hispanic-serving Institutions (HSIs), Asian American And Native American Pacific Islander-serving Institutions (AANAPISIs), Alaska Native-serving Institutions and Native Hawaiian-serving Institutions (ANNHs), Predominantly Black Institutions (PBIs), and Native American-serving Nontribal Institutions (NASNTIs), building the high tech labs and facilities and digital infrastructure needed for learning, research, and innovation, and expanding career pathways for graduates of HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs in areas that meet national priorities, including building a diverse pipeline of public school teachers. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Provide educational opportunities for women to pursue science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Too few women and people of color have been provided with the pathways to the high-skill, high wage, in-demand jobs that STEM careers offer, including in manufacturing and innovation. To address this disparity, Biden will invest in school vocational training and partnerships between high schools, community colleges, and employers. These partnerships will create programs that allow students to earn an industry credential upon high school graduation, a credential that readies them for a good-paying career. And, he will fund state-of-the-art workforce skill development, such as funds for the creation or expansion of technical training programs around digital, statistical, and technology skills, funded by the Labor Department. This will increase pathways for those — including women and workers of color — who are too often under-represented in critical technology jobs. Biden will make investments in pre-apprenticeship programs so that women have additional pathways into high-paying, union jobs in everything from designing to building infrastructure to manufacturing to technology to health. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Help develop pathways for diverse workers to access training and career opportunities.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A </span><a href="https://wdr.doleta.gov/research/FullText_Documents/ETAOP_2018-04_1-WIA-30mo-main-rpt.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Labor Department-funded individual career services — which included assistance looking for a job, help developing career plans, and one-on-one career coaching — found that earnings for workers who were provided these services increased 7 to 20%. Biden will ensure these services are universally available to all workers and people entering the workforce who need them. And, he will increase funding for community-based and proven organizations that help women and people of color access high-quality training and job opportunities.</span></li>

<ul>
<li><b>Ensure college campuses are safe for women.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Survivors and advocates have fought to hold schools accountable and give young people truly fair access to education. When survivors step forward, they should be treated with dignity and respect and heard, not silenced. The Obama-Biden Administration worked with survivors and advocates to help bring violence against women on college campuses out of the shadows and required schools change their practices. Now, the Trump Administration’s Education Department — led by Betsy DeVos — is trying to shame and silence survivors, and take away parents’ peace of mind. Instead of protecting women, they have rolled back the clock and given colleges a green light to ignore sexual violence and strip survivors of their civil rights under Title IX, guaranteeing that college campuses will be less safe for our nation’s young people. They have let colleges off the hook for protecting students by permitting them to choose to investigate only more extreme acts of violence and harassment and requiring them to investigate in a way that dissuades survivors from coming forward. Biden will immediately put this to an end and stand on the side of survivors, who deserve to have their voices heard, their claims taken seriously and investigated, and their rights upheld. </span></b></li>

Teachers and school personnel do some of the most important and hardest work, but too often they aren’t justly rewarded. As President, Biden will correct this wrong.

<p><b>EXPAND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND TACKLE HEALTH DISPARITIES</b></p>

And, over</span><a href="https://avalere.com/press-releases/repeal-of-acas-pre-existing-condition-protections-could-affect-health-security-of-over-100-million-people"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">100 million people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> no longer have to worry that an insurance company will deny coverage or charge higher premiums just because they have a</span><a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/pre-existing-conditions/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">pre-existing condition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like high blood pressure, asthma, diabetes, or even pregnancy. Insurance companies can no longer charge someone more because they are a woman — a practice which costs women</span><a href="https://publicpolicy.wharton.upenn.edu/live/news/819-the-end-of-gender-rating-womens-insurance-under"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$1 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more than men annually. Young adults can get coverage through their parents’ insurance plans until age 26. Insurance plans have to cover essential benefits like maternity care. And, insurance plans now have to cover critical recommended preventive services free of charge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But now, in the middle of a pandemic, Trump is trying to strip away all health care protections for the millions of Americans who depend on the Affordable Care Act. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As President, Biden will protect and build on Obamacare — to expand access, lower costs, and make quality, affordable health care a right for all. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read Biden’s</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">full plan for building on Obamacare with a new public option at </span></i><a href="healthcare..html"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">joebiden.com/healthcare</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Maternal Mortality</i></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the pandemic, the U.S. already had one of the highest rates of deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth relative to other developed countries, especially among Black women, who were </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2020/202001_MMR.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.5 times more likely</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to die from pregnancy complications than non-Hispanic white women, and Native women, who from 2011 to 2016 were </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternal-mortality/pregnancy-mortality-surveillance-system.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2.3 times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications than were white women. California came up with a strategy that </span><a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/abs/10.1377/hlthaff.2018.0463"><span style="font-weight: 400;">halved</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the state’s maternal death rate. As President, Biden will reduce our unacceptably high maternal mortality rate, starting by taking the California strategy nationwide. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maternal mortality is just one example of the types of health disparities that Biden will direct his Secretary of Health and Human Services to address.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Reproductive Health</i></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Affordable Care Act made historic progress ensuring access to </span><a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/birth-control-benefits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">free preventive care, including contraception</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden Plan will build on that progress. Vice President Biden supports repealing the Hyde Amendment because health care is a right that should not be dependent on one’s zip code or income. And, the public option will cover contraception and a woman’s constitutional right under </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roe v. Wade</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Biden will also:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Stop state laws violating </b><b><i>Roe v. Wade. </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden will work to codify </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roe v.

Wade</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Restore federal funding for Planned Parenthood. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Obama-Biden Administration fought Republican attacks on funding for Planned Parenthood again and again.

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Restore the Affordable Care Act’s contraception mandate in place before the U.S. Supreme Court’s </b><b><i>Hobby Lobby </i></b><b>decision. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent U.S. Supreme Court decision makes it easier for the Trump-Pence Administration to continue to strip health care from women — attempting to carve out broad exemptions to the Affordable Care Act’s commitment to giving all women free access to recommended contraception. Biden will restore the Obama-Biden policy that existed before the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hobby Lobby</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ruling: providing an exemption for houses of worship and an accommodation for nonprofit organizations with religious missions. The accommodation will allow women at these organizations to access contraceptive coverage, not through their employer-provided plan, but instead through their insurance company or a third-party administrator.</span></li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Health Care Protections for All</i></b></p>

<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>LGBTQ+ women.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Obama-Biden Administration ensured that insurance companies could no longer increase premiums merely due to someone’s gender, sexual orientation, or gender identity. But President Trump rolled back these basic health care protections for LGBTQ+ Americans. As President, Biden will defend the rights of all people — regardless of gender, sexual orientation, or gender identity — to have access to quality, affordable health care free from discrimination. He will also ensure coverage for comprehensive care, including covering care related to transitioning such as gender confirmation surgery. In addition, he will ban so-called “conversion therapy.”</span></li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Women with disabilities. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden will provide greater access to home and community-based services and long-term services and supports in the most integrated setting appropriate to each person’s needs. He will end the institutional bias in the Medicaid program and build the capacity of our system to deliver home and community-based services. In addition, Biden will direct his Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights to issue guidance for states and health insurance programs clarifying how the American with Disabilities Act applies to benefits and reimbursement decisions. Also, as directed by Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, Biden will ensure that entities funded by HHS do not deny medical care based on disability or age.   </span></b></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Incarcerated women.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Women inherently have different basic health care needs than incarcerated men. Biden will condition receipt of federal criminal justice grants on </span><a href="https://www.ncchc.org/womens-health-care"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adequate provision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of primary care and gynecological care for women, including care for pregnant women.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Women veterans.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Women currently make up </span><a href="https://www.va.gov/vetdata/docs/Quickfacts/Homepage_slideshow_4_6_20.PDF"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the veteran population, and they are projected to be more than </span><a href="https://www.va.gov/vetdata/docs/SpecialReports/Women_Veterans_2015_Final.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">16% </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">by 2043. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) must continually improve its ability to meet the unique health needs and care challenges faced by the growing number of women veterans. Biden will ensure that each VA Medical Facility has at least one full-time women’s primary care physician; and, within 200 days of taking office, make available a women veterans training module for community health care providers. Biden will also work with Congress to eliminate co-pays for preventive health care for women veterans and to enact the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2452"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deborah Sampson Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and ensure that the safety and privacy concerns of women veterans are addressed throughout his Administration. He will provide funding to ensure safe, reliable child care is available at all VA Medical centers.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Native women.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Indian Health Service (IHS) has been underfunded for decades, and does not have enough </span><a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-18-580"><span style="font-weight: 400;">doctors or nurses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to provide necessary care for American Indians and Alaska Natives. Indigenous women are particularly susceptible to a lack of preventive care, while also being far too likely to experience gender-based violence. Biden has called for dramatically increasing funding for IHS and making that funding mandatory, critical for helping Native American women access comprehensive health care, including preventive screenings, such as mammograms, trauma-informed care, and mental health treatment.</span></li>

<p><b>HELP WOMEN NAVIGATE WORK AND FAMILY </b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden has taken care of aging parents, and he’s been a single parent. He knows how hard it is to raise a family and to care for a sick family member. And, he knows how hard it is for millions of Americans who are just trying to make ends meet. The pandemic has laid bare just how hard it is for women in this country to find access to quality caregiving they need for themselves, or to juggle the responsibilities of working and also caring for family members.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the United States, women overwhelmingly take on the responsibilities of caring for their families, and thus are disproportionately impacted by the gaps in our caregiving system. Only </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2019/access-to-paid-and-unpaid-family-leave-in-2018.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one in six</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> American workers typically has access to paid family leave if they need it. </span><a href="https://www.nationalpartnership.org/our-work/resources/economic-justice/paid-leave/paid-family-and-medical-leave-racial-justice-issue-and-opportunity.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black and Latino</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> individuals are even less likely to be able to take paid leave. And, when parents are forced to choose between their jobs and caregiving responsibilities, the costs are great — both to them and to the economy. Women who need to work part-time on average earn </span><a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/part-time-pay-penalty/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lower hourly wages and benefits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And, the lack of family friendly policies is causing many women to </span><a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.103.3.251"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leave the workforce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> completely.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These decisions have real costs for families. A </span><a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/early-childhood/reports/2016/06/21/139731/calculating-the-hidden-cost-of-interrupting-a-career-for-child-care/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that a woman in her twenties who left the workforce for five years to care for her young children earns nearly 20% less over her lifetime. A similar study estimated that the absence of paid family and medical leave costs workers and their families roughly </span><a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/news/2020/01/21/479555/rising-cost-inaction-work-family-policies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$22.5 billion a year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in wages. Consequences can be especially severe for </span><a href="https://www.nationalpartnership.org/our-work/resources/economic-justice/paid-leave/paid-family-and-medical-leave-racial-justice-issue-and-opportunity.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">women of color</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who are more likely to be both breadwinners and caregivers, all while earning lower-pay to cushion the loss of work.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden will make substantial investments in the infrastructure of care in our country. He will make child care more affordable and accessible for working families, and make it easier for aging relatives and loved ones with disabilities to have quality, affordable home- or community-based care. And, he will ensure all workers have access to up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave, can earn 7 days of paid sick leave, and have fair and flexible schedules so they can more easily manage their families and careers. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden will:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Ensure mothers and all parents can access high-quality, affordable child care. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden will build our child care infrastructure back better for the long-term, including by making high-quality child care affordable and preschool available for three- and four-year-olds. His plan will cultivate the potential of young children, provide parents — primarily mothers — with career opportunities and economic security, create an additional 1.5 million early education jobs, and improve the existing jobs for the essential workers who educate our young children.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden will:</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Provide</b><a href="education.html"><b> 3- and 4-year-olds access to free, high-quality pre</b></a><b>-kindergarten,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> laying a strong foundation for children and saving parents thousands of dollars a year on child care costs.

So parents and guardians can choose what works for them, Biden will partner with states to provide a mixed delivery system that includes public school systems, child care centers and family child care providers, and Head Start. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Offer low-income and middle-class families an up to $8,000 tax credit to help pay for child care.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Families will get back as a tax credit as much as half of their spending on child care for children under age 13, up to a total of $8,000 for one child or $16,000 for two or more children. The tax credit will be refundable, meaning that families who don’t owe a lot in taxes will still benefit, and Biden will actively work with child care experts to explore ways to make it advanced, so cash-strapped families can immediately benefit from the credit. The full 50% reimbursement will be available to families making less than $125,000 a year. And, all families making between $125,000 and $400,000 will receive a partial credit ensuring that in no case will they get less under the Biden plan than they are eligible for today.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Provide access to affordable, high-quality child care</b> <b>on a sliding scale for low-income and middle-class families who would prefer this option over the tax credit for young children. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">For young children ages 0-5, Biden will adopt the child care program envisioned in Senator Murray and Congressman Bobby Scott’s bipartisan </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/568"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Child Care for Working Families Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He will:</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Save families money by helping them with child care costs. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden will partner with states to provide sliding scale subsidies so that the cost of child care for low-income and middle-class families will be based on what they can afford. For children under the age of 5, no family earning below 1.5 times the median income in their state will have to pay more than 7% of their income for quality care, which was the </span><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2016-09-30/pdf/2016-22986.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">affordable child care</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> benchmark set by the Obama-Biden Administration. Biden will also set aside a portion of the funds for tribes to expand access to quality child care for Native children, as well as for outlying areas including U.S. territories.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Invest in quality child care standards and a well-trained and well-compensated child care workforce. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The quality of care matters: nearly all of </span><a href="https://www.firstthingsfirst.org/early-childhood-matters/brain-development/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">brain development</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> happens before a child turns three-years-old. For low-income children, every dollar invested in high-quality child care can result in a </span><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w22993.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$7.30 return</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with lifetime impacts for children, as they grow up healthier, do better in school, and earn more over the course of their lifetimes. Biden will ensure families have access to the quality care their children need by working in partnership with states to ensure providers meet rigorous quality standards. These standards will include a developmentally appropriate curriculum, small class sizes, and support positive interactions between educators and children that promote children&#8217;s socio-emotional development. He will also provide funding reflective of the true cost of quality care. Recognizing that quality begins with supporting the early childhood workforce, Biden will invest in strategies to retain and grow the pool of diverse, talented early childhood educators and give them the time, resources and support &#8211; like coaches, training and education opportunities for certification, and financial stability &#8211; that they need to provide children an excellent education. (</span><a href="caregiving.html"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read more</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about his plan to elevate the compensation, benefits, training and education opportunities for certification, and dignity of early childhood educators educators.)</span></i></li>

Biden will fill critical child care shortages, including in the early mornings, evenings, and weekends, and in many rural communities and other child care deserts that do not have enough providers today. He will build safe, energy-efficient, developmentally appropriate child care facilities, including in workplaces and in child care deserts, and renovating existing facilities, so that parents and guardians never again have to search in vain for suitable child care options again. (</span><a href="caregiving.html"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read more</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about his plan for building and renovating child care facilities</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">). He will also offer bonus payments to providers who operate during nontraditional hours and create a Child Care Growth and Innovation fund that will provide grants to programs filling essential needs, including expanding access to high-quality care for families with high barriers to care. And, he will ensure all families are able to choose high-quality child care that works for them, whether a child care center, home-based care with a family child care provider, or an informal arrangement with a friend, family member, or neighbor. Biden will build on the Obama-Biden Administration’s efforts to ensure Early Head Start is an option for families that will benefit from comprehensive family support and child development resources, including through doubling </span><a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/occ/what_is_the_early_head_start_cc_partnership_final_4_508.pdf?nocache=1365689128"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early Head Start-Child Care Partnerships</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Ensure families with school-aged children have expanded access to after-school, weekend, and summer care.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Biden will expand Child Care Development Block Grant subsidies to increase the number of school-aged children up to age 13 in low-income families who can benefit from the program. Low- and middle-income families will also be able to take advantage of Biden’s expanded, refundable tax credit to help cover after-school, weekend, and summer care costs. And, Biden will expand support for community schools, which often provide before, after-school, and summer learning opportunities, and increase funding for after-school programs, community centers, and extracurriculars to keep children safe, learning, and having fun when school is not in session. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Make sure more military children have access to the quality child care Department of Defense provides. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden will fully fund installation-based child care facilities</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and expand awareness of the U.S. Department of Defense fee assistance program,</span><a href="https://www.militaryfamily.org/get-involved/policy-issues/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">as supported by leading advocates for military families</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so that military spouses can more easily pursue their education and careers and tap into respite care to relieve the stresses of deployments, and members of our military can rest easier knowing their children are well cared for. </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Expand access to dignified care for older Americans and those with disabilities. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden will help ease the financial burden on families caring for aging relatives and loved ones with disabilities and reduce unnecessary and costly hospitalizations, while providing people who need care with better, more dignified services and supports that meet their specific needs and personal choices. Biden will:</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Eliminate the current waitlist for home and community services under Medicaid. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Approximately </span><a href="https://www.kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/waiting-lists-for-hcbs-waivers/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D"><span style="font-weight: 400;">800,000 people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are on the waitlist for home and community care under Medicaid.

Biden will increase Medicaid funding to states, the District of Columbia, and outlying territories to pay for the full cost of ensuring these 800,000 individuals and families receive long-term services and supports in the most appropriate setting, with the support of qualified care providers. Following the elimination of the current waiting list, states will be given a choice to convert their current home and community based care services waivers into a new state plan option with an enhanced federal match. This will enable states to make home and community-based services more available to more people in need.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Establish a long-term services and supports innovation fund to help expand home- and community-based alternatives to institutional care. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden believes we must move aggressively to eliminate the institutional bias that pervades our public program and will dedicate substantial resources to this fund to help states and locally based entities test and scale up innovative models that expand home- and community-based alternatives. These could include a number of approaches that provide care while allowing individuals to retain independence, such as day programs and respite services that enable unpaid caregivers to work, alternative home and community models that coordinate or directly provide care, and Medicaid buy-in models. </span></li>

<p><b>Biden will also ensure women and all workers have comprehensive paid leave and fair and flexible schedules. </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Guarantee up to 12 weeks paid leave for all workers.</b> <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ncs/ebs/benefits/2019/employee-benefits-in-the-united-states-march-2019.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eight in ten workers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> don&#8217;t have dedicated paid family leave to care for a new child or loved one. Biden will create a national paid family and medical leave program to give all workers up to 12 weeks of paid leave, based on the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/463/text"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FAMILY Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Workers can use this leave to care for newborns or newly adopted or fostered children, for their own or family member’s serious health conditions, or for chosen family; or to care for injured military service members or deal with “qualifying exigencies arising from the deployment” of a family member. During their time away from the job, workers will receive at least two-thirds of their paycheck up to $4,000 so they can better afford to take leave — with low- and middle-wage workers receiving larger shares of their paycheck. All workers will qualify for the program, including public- and private-sector workers, part-time workers, independent contractors, workers who change jobs, and small business employees. Biden’s plan will also guarantee paid leave for survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking, to give them time and space to seek physical or mental care or counsel, find new housing, or take other steps to recover. Biden will pay for this national paid leave program by making sure the super wealthy pay their fair share in taxes. Biden will also </span><a href="smallbusinesses/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">make sure small businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> get the support they need to survive the crisis, keep their workers employed, and come out the other side stronger.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Require employers to permanently provide up to seven days of paid sick, family, and safe leave. <span style="font-weight: 400;">As women and all workers go back to work, they need to know that they can take time off if they get sick with COVID-19, and that their co-workers can take off as well. But current emergency paid leave law </span><a href="https://www.nationalpartnership.org/our-work/economic-justice/frontline-workers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leaves out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tens of millions of workers, with women and workers of color more likely to be excluded. Biden would ensure paid leave for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> workers who get sick with COVID-19, for as long as they need to recover and complete quarantine — leave paid for by the federal government, for a worker’s full salary up to $1,400 a week. He would also guarantee federally-funded paid leave for workers caring for family members or other loved ones sick with COVID-19. We also need to provide all workers with permanent, paid sick leave. Biden will call for the type of sick leave called for in Senator Murray and Congresswoman DeLauro’s </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/840/text"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthy Families Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, requiring employers to allow workers to accrue seven days paid sick leave for workers to go to the doctor, get a flu shot, recover from an illness, or care for a sick child or family member, or a family member with disability-related needs; and to provide survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking the ability to use their sick leave as “safe days” to get the services and assistance they may need to heal.</span></b></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Support workers’ ability to have fair and flexible schedules. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When parents choose to take a more flexible job, they are generally </span><a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/goldin/files/goldin_aeapress_2014_1.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">penalized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by earning far less per hour than if they worked in jobs with inflexible and long hours. And </span><a href="https://www.epi.org/blog/working-people-deserve-schedules-that-work/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">millions of workers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, especially low-wage workers, have to work in jobs where they often do not know their work schedules until days or hours ahead of their shifts, making it harder for them to count on a predictable paycheck and plan for family or professional needs like child care, elder care, or education. When companies ensure stable schedules, research has shown it can be a </span><a href="https://worklifelaw.org/publications/Stable-Scheduling-Study-Report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">win-win for employers and employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as productivity and sales increase and workers’ lives improve. Biden will work to ensure more workers have fair, predictable schedules and flexible schedules when they need it. Biden will build on the work of many cities and states around the country that have already passed </span><a href="https://nwlc-ciw49tixgw5lbab.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Fair-Schedules-Factsheet-v2.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fair workweek laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to give workers more stable and predictable schedules, treat part-time workers with dignity, and provide workers with options for more flexibility. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Support informal or family caregivers.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Biden will ensure that informal caregivers — family members or loved ones who do this work unpaid — are supported with a $5,000 tax credit for informal caregivers, Social Security credits for people who care for their loved ones, and professional and peer support for caregivers of wounded, injured, or ill active duty service members and veterans.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>END VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the driving forces throughout Biden’s career has been fighting back against abuses of power — whether economic or physical power. That force motivated him to write and champion the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). He wrote and spearheaded the groundbreaking VAWA in 1990 at a time when few in Washington cared about domestic violence and sexual assault. He lifted survivors’ voices, won over the skeptics, and pushed until the bill became law in 1994. The Act created a national hotline for victims. It funded shelters and crisis centers. It trained law enforcement in communities across the country so they were better prepared to investigate violence against women and support survivors of violence. And, it helped change the way Americans understand and fundamentally view violence against women. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, Biden has continued this work by leading efforts to ensure Congress passed legislation renewing and strengthening the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) three times: in 2000, 2005, and 2013. Each time, the VAWA reauthorization has upped the ante and ensured that especially vulnerable communities — from Native women to LGBTQ+ individuals — are included in the Act. Also while in the Senate, Biden introduced and helped pass the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/senate-bill/3061"><span style="font-weight: 400;">William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2008. As Vice President, he established the first White House Advisor on Violence Against Women and started a national effort to change the culture on campus sexual assault. After leaving the White House, Biden continued his work to change the culture of violence and end campus sexual assault through the Biden Foundation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As President, Biden will build on his strong track record of getting things done for survivors of gender-based violence by pursuing a bold plan to save more lives and make communities safer for all. He will:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Reauthorize VAWA and keep guns out of the hands of abusers. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of Biden’s top first 100 day priorities will be to reauthorize VAWA if Leader McConnell has still refused to bring the bill to the floor in the Senate. This reauthorization includes significant, forward-looking improvements and innovations, such as reforms to keep firearms out of the hands of abusers by closing the so-called “boyfriend loophole” and “stalking loophole.”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Expand the safety net for survivors</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of domestic and sexual violence by establishing a new coordinated housing initiative, expanding access to housing assistance, and protecting survivors from housing discrimination; providing cash assistance to survivors to help build safety and security; allowing survivors to access their retirement savings as they rebuild their lives; and guaranteeing paid domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking safe leave.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Empower and protect our young people.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Biden will expand requirements for comprehensive sexual assault, stalking, and dating violence prevention education on college campuses; expand survivors’ reporting rights and options on college campuses; restore Title IX guidance for colleges and increase fines imposed on colleges for Clery Act violations (failing to report statistics about campus safety) as well as develop stronger enforcement protocols to oversee reporting under the U.S. Department of Education; and expand prevention and services to public K-12 schools.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Support the diverse needs of survivors of violence against women. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden will strengthen and expand VAWA’s reach to women in marginalized communities. He will:</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Expand grants to enhance </b><a href="https://www.justice.gov/ovw/file/450866/download"><b>culturally-specific services</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. Since 2005, VAWA has funded a grant program to support targeted, community-driven strategies that include trauma-informed and culturally-specific programs that focus on the development of holistic prevention and intervention services for survivors from racial and ethnic minority communities. The Biden Administration will expand the resources available to scale up these initiatives and integrate a broader array of community-based organizations to address complex community needs in order to expand pathways to safety for survivors and continue to build community leadership to prevent and address domestic violence and sexual assault. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Reaffirm Tribal sovereignty to support victims and hold offenders accountable,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and expand federal resources for Alaska Native and American Indian women and girls impacted by violence and abuse.

Biden fought for tribes’ rightful authority to protect Native women from abuse, a battle won in 2013 with the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization that recognized tribes&#8217; inherent power to exercise special criminal jurisdiction over non-Indian offenders who commit domestic violence, dating violence, or violate a protection order. Biden will reaffirm tribal sovereignty and expand the crimes for which tribes can exercise special criminal jurisdiction, including sexual assault, stalking, child violence, and trafficking, through signing into law VAWA 2019. And, Biden will take a comprehensive approach to end the epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous women. He will work to close the data gap, increase funding and support for tribes in building their own programs, expand tribal authority, grow coordination among law enforcement agencies and provide additional resources to tribal enforcement, and expand access to culturally sensitive resources for survivors. He will ensure that federal law enforcement prioritizes public safety in Indian Country and with engagement from tribal communities. And, he will ensure Native people are at the table, listened to, and part of the solution.</span></li>

These survivors may run away from home to escape an abusive caregiver, or repeatedly miss school due to violence, and rather than being provided trauma-informed counseling, victim advocacy, or other supports, they are punished and thrust into a cycle of justice-system involvement — </span><a href="http://rights4girls.org/wp-content/uploads/r4g/2015/02/2015_COP_sexual-abuse_layout_web-1.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most of the time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for non-violent behavior. As President, Biden will reinvest in the National Girls Initiative of the Department of Justice Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to support communities and schools to develop gender-specific and trauma-informed prevention and treatment programs and services as alternatives to girls being placed in juvenile detention. To complement the revival of the National Girls Initiative, Biden will also expand funding for the VAWA Consolidated Youth Program.</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Protect and empower immigrant women. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden will:</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Push to repeal extreme, anti-immigrant state laws that have a chilling effect on the ability of immigrant domestic violence, sexual assault survivors, and other victims of crimes to seek safety and justice.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Some state laws drive victims and witnesses into the shadows and threaten public safety. As documented in a recent national </span><a href="https://www.tahirih.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/2019-Advocate-Survey-Final.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, immigrant victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and trafficking are increasingly afraid to contact police, pursue civil or criminal cases, or go to court to seek safety. This traps victims who either ask for help and risk deportation, retaliation by an abuser, and separation from one’s children, or stay with a violent partner and risk one’s life. Biden will work in partnership with cities, states, nonprofits, and law enforcement to build trust and push for states to repeal the laws that chill the reporting of domestic violence incidents and threaten public safety. While in U.S. care, Biden will ensure that women migrants are safeguarded against abuse or sexual assault and treated with dignity, including by providing feminine care products, banning the shackling of pregnant women, and protecting access to reproductive health care services. Biden will also follow the advice of public health experts to vastly reduce the number of people in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Border Patrol during a pandemic by releasing to their families or community-based care organizations those individuals in immigration detention, parents and children, who pose no risk to the community. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Ensure asylum laws protect people fleeing persecution. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden will end Trump’s Migrant Protection Protocols and restore our asylum laws so that they do what they should be designed to do — protect people fleeing persecution and who cannot return home safely. He will make sure women refugees and asylum seekers have access to necessary services and protections. And, he’ll reinstate explicit asylum protections — rescinded by the Trump Administration — for domestic violence and sexual violence survivors, whose home governments cannot or will not protect them.  </span></li>
</ul>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Increase visas for domestic violence survivors</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, ending processing delays, and tripling the current cap of 10,000 on U-visas. Biden will also protect immigrant survivors who have applied for U-visas under the Violence Against Women Act and Trafficking Victims Protection Act by ensuring they are not detained or deported while their applications are in process. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read Biden’s full plan to secure our values as a nation of immigrants at: </span></i><a href="immigration.html"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">joebiden.com/immigration</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Supporting women service members and veterans. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women who sign up to wear the uniform of the United States military serve our country with the same bravery and courage as male service members. They face all the same dangers and make the same sacrifices to serve —deployments overseas, long separations from loved ones, stresses on their families — while also navigating the same types of harassment and sexism that women face in every work place. Today, women make up </span><a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/demographics-us-military"><span style="font-weight: 400;">16% of enlisted troops and 19% of the officer corps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and those numbers are on the rise. Every service branch of the Armed Forces must do more to address the specific needs of women service members, especially when it comes to curbing the horrific </span><a href="https://www.stripes.com/news/us/pentagon-reports-of-sexual-assault-harassment-in-the-military-have-increased-1.627966"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rise in reports of sexual harassment and assault</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the military during the Trump Administration. Biden believes that ending assault in the military requires determined leadership and accountability at every level — starting with the commander in chief. As Vice President, Biden advocated for the creation of the Special Victims Counsel for sexual assault cases in the military. As President, he will insist that the Department of Defense leadership take urgent and aggressive action to make sure that survivors are supported and abusers are held accountable for their crimes. He will immediately appoint a commission comprised of current and former military leaders, military sexual assault survivors and their advocates, and prominent sexual assault experts, to make concrete recommendations to him within 90 days. All options will be considered to end this scourge, including how these cases should be reported and prosecuted.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">A Biden Administration will not tolerate the sexual assault culture that has become all too common in the veteran sector, and which can prevent women veterans from seeking out the support and services they have earned.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Confront online harassment, abuse, and stalking.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Biden will shine a light on the online harassment, stalking, and abuse that now is a too-frequent reality for Americans, particularly for young people and women. He will convene a National Task Force on Online Harassment and Abuse, allocate new funding for law enforcement training to tackle online abuse, and support federal and state legislation creating a civil and criminal cause of action for unauthorized disclosure of intimate images.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>End the rape kit backlog. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden has been on the forefront of the fight to harness the power of DNA testing and bring justice and security to victims of sexual violence. He will create Regional Sexual Assault Investigative Training Academies, which will provide cutting-edge, evidence-based and trauma-informed training, increase funding for the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, and ensure that law enforcement training addresses attitudes that lead to the neglect of testing for rape kits.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Change the culture that enables sexual violence. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden has long believed that lasting change starts with addressing the culture and engaging everyone to stand up and speak out against harassment and assault. As President, he will launch a new friends and family public awareness campaign. The campaign will highlight information about evidence-based bystander intervention, including what to do if you witness or become aware of abuse taking place, how to safely intervene, and when to get help.</span></li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Governments, economies, industries, and communities everywhere are made stronger when they include the full participation of women.

These statistics are bad for women, they’re bad for countries and economies, and they are likely to worsen post-pandemic. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why the Obama-Biden Administration put a direct focus on women’s and girls’ empowerment to enhance our national security. The Administration created the first U.S. </span><a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2011/12/19/fact-sheet-united-states-national-action-plan-women-peace-and-security"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Action Plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Women, Peace and Security; the first U.S. </span><a href="https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/196468.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence Globally; as well as the first U.S. </span><a href="https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/254904.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Empower Adolescent Girls. As a Senator, Biden introduced the International Violence Against Women Act (IVAWA), which provided a framework for the United States to address gender-based violence globally. The Obama-Biden administration implemented many of IVAWA’s provisions via executive action and adopted its comprehensive approach to gender-based violence. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, instead of building on the progress of the Obama-Biden Administration, Donald Trump has abandoned American leadership and adopted policies that directly harm women, including some of the world’s most vulnerable populations. The effects of Trump&#8217;s policies are compounded as women and girls disproportionately bear the negative impact of the pandemic, particularly those in already-marginalized communities or living in fragile states or as migrants, displaced persons, and refugees.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden believes that we must support women through the current health and economic crises, draw on their expertise to ensure an effective recovery, and address the factors that leave them vulnerable in the first place. Biden will restore America’s leading role as a champion for women and girls around the world and return to a government-wide focus of uplifting the rights of women and girls at home and abroad. He will: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Support women’s leadership globally. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration will break down barriers to women’s political empowerment, supporting civic education and leadership development for women and girls around the world. Biden will ensure the voices of women leaders help shape and spearhead the global COVID-19 response and recovery, leveraging their expertise, networks, and skills to optimize our efforts around the world. Biden will ensure full implementation of the Women, Peace, and Security Act, recognizing the security benefits of women’s participation and inclusion in decision-making roles. Biden</span><a href="https://www.lcwins.org/candidates"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">has pledged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to strive for gender parity and full diversity in his own national security and foreign policy appointments, elevating women into senior national security positions and ensuring that women of color are well-represented in senior ranks.</span></li>

Biden will invest in critical areas to advance the status of women, and close gaps between the economic well-being of men and women, and boys and girls around the world by: </span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increasing access to education as a driver of empowerment and accumulation of wealth. Biden will build on the work of the Obama-Biden Administration to promote girls’ education, and ensure girls have the same opportunities as boys to reach their full potential. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enhancing financially inclusive banking and increasing women’s access to capital, so that women have the resources they need to start and expand businesses. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with partners in countries and multilateral organizations to systematically tackle and eliminate legal and attitudinal barriers to equity and inclusion. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incorporating the particular challenges faced by underrepresented communities into our development policies globally, including of indigenous and ethnic minority women, Afro-Latina women, and women in the LGBTQ+ community. </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Confront gender-based violence globally. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gender-based violence is a barrier to girls’ education, and inhibits women’s full participation in politics and the economy, holding back entire communities and countries.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Globally, women are experiencing </span><a href="https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/double-pandemic-domestic-violence-age-covid-19"><span style="font-weight: 400;">higher levels of domestic violence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> due to COVID-19, while at the same time facing increased difficulty accessing resources, support, and essential sexual and reproductive health information and services. Biden will work with our partners to coordinate a global response to the crisis of gender-based violence during the pandemic and beyond by: </span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restoring U.S. funding to the United Nations Population Fund.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Launching multi-sectoral efforts to confront gender-based violence globally.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Training law enforcement to root out the corruption that enables gender-based violence and teaching authorities to effectively investigate and prosecute these crimes.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reviving America’s commitment to refugees and displaced persons and ensuring that women and girls fleeing gender-based violence are given the opportunity they deserve to seek asylum in the United States.  </span></li>
